1.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another Flight Simulator?</H2>
Did you ever want to fly a plane yourself, but lacked the money or
skills to do so? Do you belong to those real pilots, who want to
improve their skills without having to take off? Do you want to
try some dangerous maneuvers without risking your life? Or do you
just want to have fun with a more serious game not killing any
people? If any of these questions applies, PC flight simulators
are just for you.

<p>
If you are reading this you might have got already some experience either using
Microsoft<a NAME="Microsoft11">
</a>'s &#169; FS98<a NAME="FS9811">
</a>, Looking Glass<a NAME="Looking Glass11">
</a>' &#169;
Flight Unlimited II<a NAME="Flight Unlimited II11">
</a> or any other of the commercially available PC flight
simulators. As the price tag of those is usually within the 50$ range buying one of them
should not be a serious problem given the fact, that running any serious PC flight
simulator requires a hardware within the 1500$ range, despite dropping prices, at least.

<p>
Why then that effort of spending hundreds or thousands of hours of
programming to build a free simulator? Obviously there must be
good reason to do so:

<p>

<UL> 
<li> All of the commercial programs have a serious drawback: They are made
 by a small group of developers defining their properties - often
 quite inert and not listening too much to the customer.
 Anyone ever trying to contact Microsoft<a NAME="Microsoft11">
</a> will
 immediately agree.
 
<li> Commercial PC flight simulators usually try to cover a market
 segment as broad as possible. For obvious reason, most of them want
 to serve the serious pilot as well as the beginner and the gamer.
 The result are compromises. As <i>FlightGear </i>is free, there is no need
 for such compromises; it just can be given the properties its users
 want. It defines itself via building.
 
<li> Building a flight simulator is a challenge to the art of
 programming. Contributing to that project makes you belong to
 those being able to contribute to serious, ambitious and
 advanced software projects.
 
<li> It is fun. Not only is it fun to write the code (... or
 documentation...) but also to belong to that - temporarily changing
 - club of clever people on the net having discussed, struggled and finally
 succeeded in creating that project. Even reading the <i>FlightGear </i>
 mailing lists is informative and fun for itself.
</UL>
<p>
The above-mentioned points make <i>FlightGear </i>different from its competitors in several
respect. <i>FlightGear </i>aims to be a civilian,<a NAME="Flight simulator+civilian11">

<p>

<UL> 
<li> <b>Civilian:</b><a NAME="Flight simulator+civilian11">
</a> The
 project is primarily aimed to civilian flight simulation.
 It should be appropriate for simulating
 general aviation as well as civilian aircraft. However, according to
 the open concept of development that sure does not exclude someone
 taking the code and integrating military components<a NAME="military components11">
</a>.

<p>
 
<li><b>Multi-platform:</b><a NAME="Flight simulator+multi-platform11">
</a> The
 developers are attempting to keep the code as platform-independent
 as possible. This is based on their observation that
 people interested in flight simulations run quite
  a variety of computer hardware and operating systems. The present code
  supports the following Operating Systems<a NAME="Operating Systems11">

<p>
  Without doubt, the success of the Linux<a NAME="Linux11">

1.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;A short history<a NAME="history12">
</a> of <i>FlightGear </i></H2>

<p>
This project goes back to a discussion of a group of net-citizens in 1996 resulting in a
proposal written by David Murr<a NAME="Murr, David12">
</a> who, unfortunately, dropped out from
the project (as well as the net) later. The original proposal<a NAME="proposal12">
</a> is still available
from the <i>FlightGear </i>web site and can be found under

<p>
<a href="http://www.flightgear.org/proposal-3.0.1">http://www.flightgear.org/proposal-3.0.1</a>

<p>
Although the names of the people and several of the details
naturally changed in time, the spirit of that proposal was clearly
retained up to the present status of the project.

<p>
Actual coding started in summer 1996 and by the end of that year essential graphics
routines were completed. At that time, programming was mainly done and coordinated by
Eric Korpela<a NAME="Korpela, Eric12">
</a> from Berkeley University
(<a href="mailto:korpela@ssl.Berkeley.EDU">korpela@ssl.Berkeley.EDU</a>). Early code was running under Linux<a NAME="Linux12">
</a> as well as
under DOS<a NAME="DOS12">
</a>, OS/2<a NAME="OS/212">
</a>, Windows 95/NT<a NAME="Windows 95/NT12">
</a>, and Sun-OS<a NAME="Sun-OS12">
</a>. This was
quite an ambitious project, as it involved, among others, writing all the graphics
routines<a NAME="graphics
routines12">
</a> in a system-independent way just from scratch.

<p>
Development slowed down and finally stopped at the beginning of 1997 when Eric had to
complete his thesis. At this point, the project seemed to be dead and traffic on the
mailing list went down to nearly nothing.

<p>
It was Curt Olson<a NAME="Olson, Curt12">
</a> from the University of Minnesota
(<a href="mailto:curt@flightgear.org">curt@flightgear.org</a>) who re-started the project in the middle of 1997. His idea
was as simple as successful: Why invent the wheel a second time? There have been several
free flight simulators<a NAME="Flight simulator+free12">
</a> available running on
workstation<a NAME="workstation12">
</a>s under different flavors of UNIX<a NAME="UNIX12">
</a>. One of these,
LaRCsim<a NAME="LaRCsim12">
</a>, having been developed by Bruce Jackson<a NAME="Jackson, Bruce12">
</a> from NASA
(<a href="mailto:jackson@larc.nasa.gov">jackson@larc.nasa.gov</a>) seemed to be well-adapted for the present approach. Curt
took this one apart and re-wrote several of the routines in a way making them build-able
as well as run-able on the intended target platforms. The key idea in doing so was
selecting a system-independent graphics platform, i.&nbsp;e. OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL12">
</a>, for the basic
graphics routines<a NAME="graphics routines12">
</a>.
<p><br>
<p>
 
<center><img src="navion.gif"><br></center><br><p> Fig.&nbsp;1: <i>The Navion<a NAME="Navion12">
</a> flight model is one of the features <i>FlightGear </i>
inherited from LaRCsim<a NAME="LaRCsim12">
</a>. Until now it is the only one plane being fully realized
in <i>FlightGear </i> .</i>
<p><br>
<p>
In addition, a clever decision on the selection of the basic scenery<a NAME="scenery12">
</a> data was
already made in this very first version. <i>FlightGear </i>Scenery is created based on
satellite data published by the U.&nbsp;S. Geological Survey<a NAME="U.\,S. Geological Survey12">
</a>. These terrain data are
available for the whole world over the Internet for free from

<p>
 <a href="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/doc/edchome/ndcdb/ndcdb.html">http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/doc/edchome/ndcdb/ndcdb.html</a>

<p>
 for the US resp.

<p>
 <a href="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/gtopo30/gtopo30.html">http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/gtopo30/gtopo30.html</a>

<p>
 for other countries. Those freely accessible scenery data in
 conjunction with scenery building tools provided with
 <i>FlightGear </i>are an important prerequisite enabling anyone to
  create his or her own scenery, at least in principle.

<p>
This new <i>FlightGear </i>code - still largely being based on original LaRCsim<a NAME="LaRCsim12">
</a> code -
was released in July 1997. From that moment the project gained momentum again. Here are
some milestones from the more recent history of development:

<p>

<UL>
<li> Sun, moon and stars are a field where PC flight simulators
 have been notoriously weak for ages. It is one of the great
 achievements of <i>FlightGear </i>that it includes accurate sun (watch, Microsoft!),
 moon, and planets, being moreover placed on their proper positions.
 The corresponding astronomy code<a NAME="astronomy code12">
</a> was implemented in fall 1997 by Durk
 Talsma<a NAME="Talsma, Durk12">
</a>
 (<a href="mailto:pn_talsma@macmail.psy.uva.nl">pn_talsma@macmail.psy.uva.nl</a>).

<p>

<li> Texture support<a NAME="textures12">
</a> was added by Curt
Olson<a NAME="Olson, Curt12">
</a>
 (<a href="mailto:curt@flightgear.org">curt@flightgear.org</a>) in spring 1998. This marked a
 significant improvement in terms of reality. You may recall: MSFS had
 untextured scenery up to version 4.0. For this purpose, some high-quality
 textures were submitted by Eric Mitchell<a NAME="Mitchell, Eric12">
</a>
 (<a href="mailto:mitchell@mars.ark.com">mitchell@mars. ark.com</a>.

<p>

<li> A HUD<a NAME="HUD12">
</a> (head up display<a NAME="head up display12">
</a>) was added based on code
 provided by Michele America<a NAME="America, Michele12">
</a>
 (<a href="mailto:nomimarketing@mail.telepac.pt">nomimarketing@mail.telepac.pt</a>) and
 Charlie Hotchkiss<a NAME="Hotchkiss, Charlie12">
</a>
(<a href="mailto:chotchkiss@namg.us.anritsu.com">chotch kiss@namg.us.anritsu.com</a>)
 in fall 1997 and continuously improved later, mainly by Norman Vine
(<a href="mailto:nhv@laserplot.com">nhv@laserplot.com</a>).
 While being probably not a substitute for a panel<a NAME="panel12">
</a> and moreover
 possibly being a bit odd in that tiny Navion<a NAME="Navion12">
</a>, this HUD<a NAME="HUD12">
</a> has proven
 extremely useful in navigation until now.

<p>

<li> After improving scenery<a NAME="scenery12">
</a> and
texture<a NAME="textures12">
</a> support and adding some more
 features there was a disappointing side-effect in spring 1998: Frame
 rates<a NAME="frame rate12">
</a> dropped down to a point where <i>FlightGear </i>became inflyable. There
 were two main achievements overcoming this problem. First, with the advent
 of hardware OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL12">
</a> support and corresponding drivers for most of
 the graphics cards these features could be exploited in
 <i>FlightGear </i>as well, leading to a frame rate<a NAME="frame rate12">
</a> boost by a
 factor up to 10. Second, Curt Olson<a NAME="Olson, Curt12">
</a> (<a href="mailto:curt@flightgear.org">curt@flightgear.org</a>)
 implemented so-called view frustrum culling<a NAME="view frustrum culling12">
</a> (a procedure to except part of
 the scenery not required from  rendering) which gave another 20% or so of
 frame rate boost in May 1998.

<p>
 With these two achievements <i>FlightGear </i>became flyable again even on weaker
 machines as long as they included a 3D graphics board with
 hardware OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL12">
</a> support. With respect to this point one should keep in mind that code
 at present is in no way optimized leaving a lot of room for further
 improvements of frame rate.

<p>

<li> A rudimentary autopilot<a NAME="autopilot12">
</a> implementing heading hold was
contributed by Jeff Goeke-Smith<a NAME="Goeke-Smith, Jeff12">
</a> (<a href="mailto:jgoeke@voyager.net">jgoeke@voyager.net</a>) in
April 1998. The autopilot was improved, included adding an altitude hold and a terrain
follow switch, in October 1998.

<p>

<li> The basics for selectable menu<a NAME="menu12">
</a>s were laid based on Steve Baker's<a NAME="Baker, Steve12">
</a>
  (<a href="mailto:sjbaker@ hti.com">sjbaker@ hti.com</a>) portable library PLIB<a NAME="PLIB12">
</a> in June 1998. After having been idle for a
  long time, first working menu entries came to life in spring 1999.

<p>

<li> Friedemann Reinhard <a NAME="Reinhard, Friedemann12">
</a>
(<a href="mailto:mpt218@faupt212.physik.uni-erlangen.de">mpt218@faupt212.physik.uni-erlangen.de</a>)
 developed early panel code<a NAME="panel code12">
</a>, including a working airspeed
 indicator<a NAME="airspeed
 indicator12">
</a>, which was added in June 1998 and has been considerably improved until today.

<p>

<li> There was basic audio support<a NAME="audio support12">
</a>, i.&nbsp;e. an audio library and some basic background engine sound, contributed by Steve
Baker (<a href="mailto:sjbaker@hti.com">sjbaker@hti.com</a>)<a NAME="Baker, Steve12">
</a> in Summer 1998. Today, the audio
library is part of Steves's above-mentioned portable library PLIB<a NAME="PLIB12">
</a>. This same
library was extended to support joystick /yoke/rudder later which brought <i>FlightGear </i>
joystick support in October 1989, again marking a huge improvement in terms of realism.

<p>

<li> In September 1998 Curt Olson<a NAME="Olson, Curt12">
</a>
(<a href="mailto:curt@flightgear.org">curt@flightgear.org</a>) succeeded in creating first complete terrain Scenery for the
USA, which is available for download from

<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.kingmont.com/pub/kingmont/">ftp://ftp.kingmont.com/pub/kingmont/</a>

<p>
Scenery was further improved by Curt via adding features like lakes, rivers, coastlines
and the like in spring 1999.

<p>

<li> In June 1999 there was a split of the source tree into a stable and a developmental
branch. Even version numbers as 0.6, 0.8, and (hopefully) 1.0 refer to stable versions
being intended for general use while odd versions as 0.7 and so on refer to developmental
versions. Policy is to do only bug fixes in the even versions, while new features are
generally added to odd-numbered versions, which finally after things stabilized will turn
into the next stable version by adding 0.1. At present (and probably in the future), this
guide refers to the stable branch. <A NAME="branches">
</A>

<p>
</UL>This is by no way a complete history and a lot of people making even important
contributions were left out here. Besides the named achievements being more on the
surface there was a lot of work done concerning the internal structure, by Steve
Baker<a NAME="Baker, Steve12">
</a> (<a href="mailto:sjbaker@hti.com">sjbaker@hti.com</a>)<a NAME="Baker, Steve12">
</a>, Norman
Vine<a NAME="Vine, Norman12">
</a> (<a href="mailto:nhv@laserplot.com">nhv@laserplot.com</a>), Gary R. Van Sickle<a NAME="Van Sickle,
Gary, R.12">
</a> (<a href="mailto:tiberius@braemarinc.com">tiberius@braemarinc.com</a>), and others. A more complete list of
contributors to the project can be found in <i>Landing: Some further thoughts before

1.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;System requirements</H2><a NAME="system requirements13">
</a>
Compared to other recent flight simulators the system requirements
for <i>FlightGear </i>are rather decent. A P100 is already sufficient,
given you have a proper 3D graphics card, but of course for
getting good performance we recommend a P200 or better, if you run
it on a PC. On the other hand, any not too ancient UNIX<a NAME="UNIX13">

workstation<a NAME="workstation13">
</a> will run <i>FlightGear </i>as well.

<p>
While in principle you can run <i>FlightGear </i>on 3D boards without OpenGL support or even on
systems without 3D graphics hardware at all, missing hardware OpenGL support can force
even the fastest PIII to its knees (frame rate<a NAME="frame rate13">
</a>s typically below 1 fps). Any cheap
3D graphics card will do as long as it features hardware OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL13">
</a> support. For
Windows 98/NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT13">
</a> drivers, you may contact the home page of the manufacturer.
Moreover, you should have in mind that several OpenGL drivers<a NAME="OpenGL+drivers13">
</a> are
still marked as beta and moreover, and sometimes these drivers are provided by the makers
of the graphics chip instead of the makers of the board. More detail on OpenGL drivers
can be found under

<p>
<a href="http://www.x-plane.com/v4ibm.html">http://www.x-plane.com/v4ibm.html</a>

<p>
  as well as under

<p>
<a href="http://www.flightgear.org/Hardware">http://www.flightgear.org/Hardware</a>.

<p>
Next, you need around 16MB of free disk space for installing the executable including
basic scenery. In case you want to compile the program yourself you need around 50MB for
the source code and for temporary files created during compilation, independent of the
operating system.

<p>
If you want to hear the sound effects<a NAME="sound effects13">
</a> any decent sound card<a NAME="sound card13">
</a> should serve.
Besides, <i>FlightGear </i>supports a joystick<a NAME="joystick13">
</a> or yoke<a NAME="yoke13">
</a> as well as rudder
pedals<a NAME="rudder
pedals13">
</a> under Linux<a NAME="Linux13">
</a> as well as under Windows<a NAME="Windows13">
</a>.

<p>
With respect to operating systems, <i>FlightGear </i>is being primarily developed under
Linux<a NAME="Linux13">
</a>, a free UNIX clone developed cooperatively over the net in much the same
way as the <i>FlightGear </i>project itself. Moreover, <i>FlightGear </i>runs under Windows
95<a NAME="Windows
9513">
</a>, Windows 98<a NAME="Windows 9813">
</a> and Windows NT<a NAME="Windows NT13">
</a> and given you have a proper
compiler<a NAME="compiler13">
</a> installed can be build under all of these platforms as well. The primary
compiler for all platforms is the free GNU C++<a NAME="GNU C++13">
</a> (i.&nbsp;e. the Cygnus<a NAME="Cygnus13">
</a>
compiler under Win32), however there is some support for MSVC<a NAME="MSVC13">
</a> as well. Moreover,
<i>FlightGear </i>runs and can be build on several UNIX<a NAME="UNIX13">
</a>/X11 platforms with GNU C++
installed.

      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom this guide is addressed to and how it is organized</H2>

<p>
At first: There is not much of the material in this Guide being originally invented by
ourself. You could even say with Montaigne that we ''merely gathered here a big bunch of
other men's flowers, having furnished nothing of my own but the strip to hold them
together''. Most (but fortunately not all) of the information can as well be grabbed from
the <i>FlightGear </i>home page<a NAME="\FlightGear home page14">
</a> being situated at

<p>
<a href="http://www.flightgear.org/">http://www.flightgear.org/</a>

<p>
  and its various sub pages. However, there still seems to
be a small group of people preferring neatly printed manuals over
loosely scattered Readmes and those may acknowledge our effort.

<p>
This <i>Installation and Getting Started</i> is intended as being a first step towards
a more complete <i>FlightGear </i>documentation<a NAME="\FlightGear documentation14">
</a> (with the other parts, supposedly, to
be written by others). Its main addressee is the end-user who is not interested in the
internal workings of OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL14">
</a> or in building his or her own scenery, for instance.
It is our hope, that sometime there will be an accompanying <i><i>FlightGear </i>
Programmer's Guide<a NAME="\FlightGear
Programmer's Guide14">
</a></i>, which could be based on some of the documentation under

<p>
<a href="http://www.flightgear.org/Docs">http://www.flightgear.org/Docs</a>,

<p>
 a <i><i>FlightGear </i>Scenery Design Guide<a NAME="\FlightGear Scenery Design Guide14">
</a></i>, and a
<i><i>FlightGear </i>Flight School<a NAME="\FlightGear Flight School14">
</a></i>, at least.

<p>
This <i>Installation and Getting Started</i> is organized as
follows:

<p>
The first Chapter <A href="#opengl">2</A>, <i>Getting the engine: Installing OpenGL graphics
drivers</i>, describes how to prepare the computer for handling <i>FlightGear </i>'s graphics
routines. <i>FlightGear </i>is based on a graphics library called OpenGL, thus you must install
either hardware or software OpenGL support for your graphics board (except, you did so
before).

<p>
Chapter <A href="#building">3</A>, <i>Building the plane: Compiling the program</i>, explains how
to build, i.&nbsp;e. compile the simulator. Depending on your platform this may or may not be
required for you. There will at least be binaries available for those working on a Win32
(i.&nbsp;e. Windows 98 &#169; or Windows NT &#169;) platform. For those on such
systems, who want to take off immediately without going through the potentially
troublesome process of compiling, we recommend just skipping that Chapter and going
directly to the next one.

<p>
In Chapter <A href="#prefligh">4</A>, <i>Preflight: Installing <i>FlightGear </i></i>, you find
instructions for installing the binaries in case you did not so by building them in the
previous Chapter. Moreover, you'll have to install scenery and texture files, which will
be described there, too.

<p>
The following Chapter <A href="#takeoff">5</A>, <i>Takeoff: How to start the program</i>,
describes how to start the program including an overview on the command line options.

<p>
Chapter <A href="#flight">6</A>, <i>Flight: All about instruments, keystrokes and menus</i>,
describes how to operate the program, i.&nbsp;e. to actually fly with
<i>FlightGear </i> . This includes a (hopefully) complete list of key strokes, an
overview on the menu entries, as well as a detailed description of the HUD (head up
display) and the panel.

<p>
In Chapter <A href="#landing">7</A>, <i>Landing: Some further thoughts before leaving the
plane</i>, we would like to give credits to those who did the hard work, and give an outlook
on what remains to be done.

<p>
Finally: <b>We kindly ask others to help us improving this document by submitting
corrections, improvements, and more. Notably, we invite others to contribute descriptions
referring to alternative setups (graphics cards, operating systems, and compilers etc.).
We will be more than happy to include those into forthcoming versions of this
<i>Installation and Getting Started</i> (of course not without giving credit to the
authors).</b>

<p>
We hope to continuously maintain this document at least for a foreseeable future, but
probably will not be able to produce a new one for any single release of <i>FlightGear </i>.
While we are both watching the mailing lists, it might help, if developers adding new
functionality could send us a short note.

</a><A NAME="opengl">
</A></H1>
<i>FlightGear </i>'s graphics engine is based on a graphics library<a NAME="graphics library20">
</a> called
OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL20">
</a>. Its primary advantage is it's platform independence, i.&nbsp;e., programs
written with OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL20">
</a> support can be compiled and executed on several platforms,
given the proper drivers having been installed in advance. Thus, independent of if you
want to run the binaries only or if you want to compile the program yourself you must
install some sort of OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL20">
</a> support for your video card<a NAME="video card20">
</a>. Naturally, you
can skip this Chapter in case you already did (maybe for Quake or some other game).

<p>
Unfortunately, there are so many graphics boards, graphics chips and drivers that we are
unable to provide a complete description for all systems. To give beginners a hand, we
just describe what we did to install drivers on our systems, which might be not too
exotic.

<p>
By any means, try getting hardware OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL20">
</a> drivers for your system, which is
exemplary described in Sections <A href="#3dfxlinux">2.1</A> to <A href="#3DFXwin98">2.4</A>, resp. If you are
unable to locate any such drivers you can try software support<a NAME="OpenGL+software
support20">
</a> as detailed under <A href="#softrend">2.5</A>.

2.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3DFX<a NAME="3DFX21">
</a> under Linux<a NAME="Linux21">
</a><A NAME="3dfxlinux">
</A></H2>

<p>
An excellent place to search for documentation about Linux and 3D accelerators is the
<i>Linux Quake<a NAME="Quake21">
</a> HOWTO</i> at

<p>
<a href="http://www.linuxquake.com">http://www.linuxquake.com</a>.

<p>
It describes all the following steps in an in-depth fashion and
should be your first aid in case something goes wrong with your 3D
setup.

<p>
The 3DFX<a NAME="3DFX21">
</a> graphics card is a quite popular one (We tested
the Voodoo<a NAME="Voodoo21">
</a>1 to work). At first, you need the GLIDE<a NAME="GLIDE21">
</a>
library installed. Grab it at:

<p>
<a href="http://www.3dfx.com/software/download_glidel.html">http://www.3dfx.com/software/download_glidel.html</a>

<p>
 and install it.
Be careful, you need different Glide libraries for the different types of VooDoos (I, II, III Banshee).
There is even an install script included that will do things for you. The canonical place
for GLIDE<a NAME="GLIDE21">
</a> is <tt>/usr/local/glide</tt>, if you prefer another location, you'll
have to edit the Makefile for <i>FlightGear </i>by hand. Be sure to read and understand the
file <tt>/usr/local/glide/README</tt>. Next, you need to install the MESA<a NAME="MESA21">
</a> library
version 3.0 (or later). Grab it at

<p>
 <a href="ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa">ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa</a>,

<p>
 unpack it and run

<p>
  <tt>make linux-glide</tt>

<p>
 in the Mesa<a NAME="Mesa21">
</a> directory. Follow the instructions in the <tt>README</tt> file, take
a close look at <tt>README.3DFX</tt> and play with the demo programs.

<p>
Besides these, you need the GLUT<a NAME="GLUT21">
</a> library version 3.7 (or
greater, aka GameGLUT) installed. Grab it at:

<p>
   <a href="http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html">http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html</a>.

<p>
 Note: Glut-3.7 is included with Mesa<a NAME="Mesa21">
</a> 3.0 so if you've already grabbed the latest
version of mesa, you should have everything you need.

<p>
For the lazy of you, there is of course the possibility to install the 3D stuff included
in your distribution. At least RedHat<a NAME="RedHat21">
</a> 6.0 and SuSE<a NAME="SuSE21">
</a> 6.1 are known to
contain all the necessary stuff.

<p>
Finally, some more notes on the behavior of Voodoo<a NAME="Voodoo21">
</a> boards:

<p>
Your card comes packaged with a loop-through-cable<a NAME="loop-through-cable21">
</a>. If you
have only one monitor, then the Voodoo will take it over when
used. This means that all the applications on your desktop will
continue running but you'll only see the <i>FlightGear </i>screen. If
your window manager uses a focus-follows-mouse policy, don't move
the mouse. If you lose the focus, there's no way to shut down
<i>FlightGear </i>graciously! Better solution: Use two monitors, one for
your desktop, connect the other one to your accelerator. You'll
then get a window on your desktop which manages all keyboard
events and you're still able to see your desktop.

<p>
Running <i>FlightGear </i>under Linux using a 3DFX accelerator board is
somewhat tricky. Most of the boards behavior is controlled by
environment variables.<a NAME="environment variable21">
</a> The two most
important are:

<p>

<UL>
<li><tt>MESA_GLX_FX</tt>: When set to <tt>f</tt> rendering will be in
  fullscreen mode,
    <tt>w</tt> will perform rendering in a window at a significant speed penalty.
  
<p>

<li> <tt>FX_GLIDE_NO_SPLASH</tt>:
  When set to <tt>1</tt> the rotating 3DFX logo
  won't appear. For a description of all environment
  variables<a NAME="environment variable21">
</a> for  VooDooI/II have a look at

<p>
<a href="http://www.bahnhof.se/~engstrom/e_3dfxvars.htm">http://www.bahnhof.se/&#126;engstrom/e_3dfxvars.htm</a>.

<p>
</UL>This completes preparing your 3DFX<a NAME="3DFX21">
</a> equipped Linux PC for running
<i>FlightGear </i> .
Now proceed and install the support files as described later in this document.

</A></H2>

<p>
This Section serves as an example for installing OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL22">
</a> drivers under
Windows 98/NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT22">
</a>. The Rendition 2100 chipset<a NAME="Rendition 2100 chipset22">
</a> is, for instance, included in
the Diamond Stealth II<a NAME="Diamond Stealth II22">
</a> card performing especially well in somewhat weaker
machines.

<p>
Diamond itself does not provide any OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL22">
</a> driver support for that board.
However, Rendition, who make the graphics chip, do. Go to their Web site and grab the
latest OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL22">
</a> Windows drivers<a NAME="Windows drivers22">
</a> from

<p>
   <a href="http://www.rendition.com/download.html">http://www.rendition.com/download.html</a>

<p>
 Follow the description in <tt>readme.txt</tt>. We recommend making
the drivers the default ones by copying them to
<tt>\windows\system</tt> (which avoids the
hassle of not being sure which driver actually runs).

<p>
With this step you're already done.

<p>
According to our experience, so-called mini-OpenGL<a NAME="mini-OpenGL22">
</a> drivers
provided by some manufacturers for making Quake playable do not
provide the level of OpenGL support required by <i>FlightGear </i>. At
least, Rendition's mini-OpenGL<a NAME="mini-OpenGL22">
</a> driver definitely does not.

<p>

Because of its high performance, the RIVA TNT is one of the most popular chipsets today.
The Diamond Viper 550<a NAME="Diamond Viper 55023">
</a>,  ELSA Erazor-2, Creative Graphics Blaster<a NAME="Creative Graphics Blaster23">
</a>, and
more cards come equipped with this chip. At least the default Viper 550 drivers are known
to us having native built-in OpenGL support making any add-on OpenGL drivers obsolete.
Similar things should apply to the other RIVA TNT based boards. In any case, NVIDIA's
reference drivers being available from

<p>
    <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">http://www.nvidia.com/</a>

<p>
 do the job as well.

<p>
The 3DXF<a NAME="3DXF24">

</a> made Beta OpenGL
Windows 98 drivers available on their Website at

<p>
<a href="http://www.3dfx.com">http://www.3dfx.com</a>.

<p>
 From the main page go to <tt>Develop 3DFX</tt> and further to <tt>SDKs and
Demos</tt> and grab them there.

<p>
First, make sure you have the file <tt>glu32.dll</tt> either under
<tt>\Windows\System</tt> or elsewhere in your path. If not, install
the MS OpenGL kit <tt>opengl95</tt> available from Microsoft or elsewhere on the net
(which by itself only provides software rendering).

<p>
Next, locate the file <tt>3dfxopengl.dll</tt>. in the 3DFX driver package, rename it to
<tt>opengl32.dll</tt> and copy it into <tt>\Windows\System</tt>
overwriting the file with the same name installed from the MS kit. This should get you
going.

<p>
If you have an accelerated 3D card, it is highly recommended you
install hardware OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL25">
</a> drivers for your specific card.

<p>
However, in case you are really unable to find such drivers and
want to try <i>FlightGear </i>despite this you can install SGI software
OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL25">

<tt>sgi-opengl2.exe</tt> from

<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Misc/">ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Misc/</a>.

<p>
 This is a Windows 98/NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT25">

program. Install it by double-clicking in Windows explorer. The
package includes some demo games you may wish to try by invoking
them from the Start menu.

Chapter 3     </A><br>Building the plane: Compiling<a NAME="compiling30">
</a> the program<A NAME="building">
</A></H1>
This central Chapter describes how to build <i>FlightGear </i>on several systems. In case you
are on a Win32 (i.&nbsp;e. Windows 98 or Windows NT) platform you may not want to go though
that potentially troublesome process but instead skip that Chapter and straightly go to
the next one. (Not everyone wants to build his or her plane himself or herself, right?)
However, there may be good reason at least to try building the simulator:

<p>

<UL>
<li> In case you are on a UNIX<a NAME="UNIX30">
</a>/Linux<a NAME="Linux30">
</a> platform there are supposedly no
pre-compiled binaries<a NAME="binaries, pre-compiled30">
</a> available for your system. We do not
see any reason why the distribution of pre-compiled binaries (with statically linked
libraries) should not be possible for UNIX<a NAME="UNIX30">
</a> systems in principle as well, but in
practice it is common to install programs like this one on UNIX<a NAME="UNIX30">
</a> systems by
recompiling them.

<p>

<li> There are several options you can set only during
compile time. One such option is the decision to compile with
hardware or software OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL30">
</a> rendering enabled. A more
complete list goes beyond this <i>Installation and Getting
Started</i> and should be included in a future
<i><i>FlightGear </i>Programmer's Guide<a NAME="\FlightGear Programmer's Guide30">
</a></i>.

<p>

<li> You may be proud you did.
</UL>
<p>
On the other hand, compiling <i>FlightGear </i>is not a task for novice users. Thus, if you're
a beginner (we all were once) we recommend postponing this and just starting with the
binary distribution to get you flying.

<p>
Besides, there have been two branches of code starting from version 0.6. For more
details, see Section <A href="#branches">1.2</A>. This description generally refers to the stable,
even-numbered branch. It is almost certain, that odd-numbered versions require
modifications to that.

<p>
As you will note, this Chapter is far from being complete. Basically, we describe
compiling for two operating systems only, Windows 98/NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT30">
</a> and Linux<a NAME="Linux30">
</a>. There
is a simple explanation for this: These are just the systems we are working on. We hope
to be able to provide descriptions for more systems based on contributions written by
others.

3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Compiling<a NAME="compiling+Linux31">
</a> under Linux<a NAME="Linux31">
</a></H2>

<p>
If you are running Linux you probably have to build your own
binaries<a NAME="binaries31">
</a>. The following is one way to do so.

<p>

<OL type="1">
<li> <i>FlightGear </i>needs some supplementary libraries which are usually
  not contained in any distribution we know of. These are:

<p>
  
<UL>  
<li><em>plib</em> which is absolutely essential for the building
    process. Get the latest version of <em>plib</em> at
    <a href="http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/plib/">http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/plib/</a> and follow the
    instructions contained in README.plib.

<p>
  
<li><em>gfc</em> is only needed if you want to build the scenery
    generation tools but it doesn't hurt to have it installed. It can
    be found along with the building instructions at
    <a href="http://www.geog.psu.edu/~qian/gfc/index.html">http://www.geog.psu.edu/&nbsp;qian/gfc/index.html</a>.

<p>
  
<li><em>gpc</em> which is also needed for the scenery generation
    tools. Get it from
    <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/aig/staff/alan/software/">http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/aig/staff/alan/software/</a>, building
    instructions can be found in README.gpc in your <i>FlightGear </i>source
    directory.

<p>
  </UL>  Now you are ready to proceed to the task of getting, compiling and installing <i>FlightGear </i>itself:

<p>

<li> Get the file <tt>FlightGear-x.xx.tar.gz</tt> from the
  <tt>source</tt> subdirectory under

<p>
 <a href="ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Source/">ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Source/</a>

<p>
 
<li> Unpack it using :

<p>
        <tt>tar xvfz FlightGear-x.xx.tar.gz</tt>.

<p>

<li> <tt>cd</tt> into <tt>FlightGear-x.xx</tt>. Run:

<p>
        <tt>./configure</tt>

<p>
 and wait a few minutes. configure<a NAME="configure31">
</a> knows about a lot of
options. Have a look at the file <tt>INSTALL</tt> in the
<i>FlightGear </i>source directory to learn about them. If run without
options, configure assumes that you will install the data files
under <tt>/usr/local/lib/FlightGear</tt>.

<p>

<li> Assuming configure finished successfully, simply run

<p>
        <tt>make</tt>

<p>
 and wait for the make process to finish.

<p>

<li> Now become root (for example by using the su command) and
type

<p>
        <tt>make install</tt>.

<p>
 This will install the binaries<a NAME="binaries31">
</a> in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>.

<p>
There is a problem concerning permissions under Linux/Glide. All programs accessing the
accelerator board need root permissions. The solution is either to play as root (this is
<em>bad</em> practice and not always possible) or make the <tt>/usr/local/bin/fgfs</tt>
binary <tt>setuid root</tt>, i.e. when this binary is run root privileges are given. Do
this by issuing (as root)

<p>
   <tt>chmod +s /usr/local/bin/fgfs</tt>.

<p>
  Again, this is a quick and dirty hack.  The perfect solution for this
 problem is using a kernel module called <em>3dfx.o</em>. It is available
 along with documentation at <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/3dfx/index.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/&nbsp;carlo17/3dfx/index.html</a>
 and it might be a good idea to read some of the Quake-related links there!

<p>
 To install this kernel module, just download it, become root and
 issue the following commands:

<p>
<tt>mkdir dev3dfx</tt>

<p>
<tt>cd dev3dfx</tt>

<p>
<tt>tar xvfz ../Dev3Dfx-2.7.tar.gz</tt>

<p>
<tt>make</tt>

<p>
<tt>cp 3dfx.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc</tt>

<p>
<tt>mknod /dev/3dfx c 107 0</tt>

<p>
<tt>insmod 3dfx</tt>

<p>
It is a good idea to put the last line into one of your bootup scripts! After having
installed this module, you can even go ahead and remove the S-bit from <em>all</em> programs
that need access to your 3D hardware.

<li> Windows, contrary to Linux which brings its own compiler, comes
not equipped with developmental tools. Several compilers have been shown to work for

other Compilers provide one.

<p>

<li>  Install and configure the Cygnus<a NAME="Cygnus32">
</a> Gnu-Win32 development
    environment. The latest version is Beta 20. The main
    Cygnus Gnu-Win32 page is at:

<p>
        <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/</a>.

<p>
     You can download the complete Cygnus Gnu-Win32 compiler from:

<p>
        <a href="ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/latest/full.exe">ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/latest/full.exe</a>.

<p>
    Be sure to read this package's README files to be found under the main page, first.

<p>
     To install the compiler, just run <tt>full.exe</tt> by double-clicking in
    Windows explorer.  After doing so you'll find a program group called
    <tt>Cygnus Solutions</tt> in your Start menu. Do not forget making a copy of the
    shell under c:/bin, as detailed in the docs.

<p>

<li>  Open the Cygnus shell via its entry in the Start menu.
    Mount the drive where you want to build <i>FlightGear </i>as follows
    (assuming your <i>FlightGear </i>drive is <tt>d:</tt>):

<p>
         <tt>mkdir /mnt</tt><br>
         <tt>mount d: /mnt</tt>

<p>
     You only have to do this once. The drive stays mounted (until you
    umount it) even through reboots and switching off the machine.

<p>

<li> Before actually being able to compile <i>FlightGear </i>you have to install a hand full
of support libraries required for building the simulator itself. Those go usually into
<tt>c:/usr/local</tt> and it is highly recommended to choose just that place.

<p>
 First, you have to install the free win32 api library<a NAME="win32 api library32">
</a> (the latest
 version being 0.1.5). Get the package <tt>win32api-0.1.5.tar.gz</tt> from:

<p>
    <a href="http://www.acc.umu.se/~anorland/gnu-win32/w32api.html">http://www.acc.umu.se/&nbsp;anorland/gnu-win32/w32api.html</a>

<p>
Conveniently you may unpack the package just onto you <i>FlightGear </i>drive. Copy the file to
the named drive, open the Cygnus shell via the Start menu entry and change to the
previously mounted drive with

<p>
 <tt>cd /mnt</tt>

<p>
 Now, you can unpack the distribution with

<p>
 <tt>gzip -d win32api-0.1.5.tar.gz</tt><br>
 <tt>tar xvf win32api-0.1.5.tar</tt>

<p>
 This provides you with a directory containing the named libraries. For installing them,
 change to that directory with

<p>
<tt>cd win32api-0.1.5</tt>

<p>
and type

<p>
 <tt>make</tt><br>
 <tt>make install</tt>

<p>
This installs the libraries to their default locations under <tt>c:/usr/local</tt>

<p>

<li> To proceed, you need the glut libraries<a NAME="glut libraries32">
</a>. Get these from the same site named
above

<p>
<a href="http://www.acc.umu.se/~anorland/gnu-win32/w32api.html">http://www.acc.umu.se/&nbsp;anorland/gnu-win32/w32api.html</a>

<p>
as <tt>glutlibs-3.7beta.tar.gz</tt>. Just copy the package to your <i>FlightGear </i>drive and
unpack it in the same way as describes above. There is no need to run <tt>make</tt> here.
Instead, just copy the two libraries <tt>libglut.a</tt> and <tt>libglut32.a</tt> to
<tt>c:/usr/local/lib</tt>. There is no need for the two accompanying <tt>*.def</tt> files
here.

<p>

<li> Next, get the Glut header files<a NAME="Glut header files32">
</a>, for instance, from

<p>
<a href="ftp:://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Win32/Mesa-3.0-includes.zip">ftp:://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Win32/Mesa-3.0-includes.zip</a>

<p>
Unpack these as usual with <tt>unzip -d</tt> and copy the contents of the resulting
directory <tt>/gl</tt> to <tt>c:/usr/local/include/gl</tt>

<p>

<li> Finally, you need Steve Backer's PLIB<a NAME="PLIB32">
</a> being one of the key libraries for <i>FlightGear </i> .
Get the most recent version <tt>plib-X.X.tar.gz</tt> from

<p>
<a href="http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/plib/">http://www.woodsoup.org/projs/plib/</a>

<p>
(There are mirrors, but make sure they contain the most recent version!). Copy it to your
<i>FlightGear </i>drive, open the Cygnus shell and unpack the library as described above.

<p>
Next, change into PLIB<a NAME="PLIB32">
</a>'s directory. It is recommended to configure PLIB<a NAME="PLIB32">
</a>
with the following command line (you can make a script as I did if it hurts)

<p>
CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall" CXXFLAGS="-O2 -Wall"<br> CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure
-prefix=/usr/local<br>
 -includedir=/usr/local/include/plib

<p>
You must write all this <b>on one line</b> without any line breaks in between!

<p>
Finally, build PLIB<a NAME="PLIB32">
</a> with

<p>
 <tt>make</tt><br>
 <tt>make install</tt>

<p>

<li> Now, you're finally prepared to build <i>FlightGear </i>itself.

<p>
 Fetch the <i>FlightGear </i>code and special Win32 libraries<a NAME="Win32 libraries32">
</a>.  These
can be found at:

<p>
 <a href="ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Source/">ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Source/</a>

<p>
     Grab the latest <tt>FlightGear-X.XX.zip</tt> and
    <tt>win32-libs-X.XX.zip</tt> files.

<p>
(It you're really into adventures, you can try one of the recent snapshots instead.)

<p>

<li> Unpack the <i>FlightGear </i>source code via

<p>
        <tt>pkunzip -d FlightGear-X.XX.zip</tt>.

<p>
 
<li>  Change to the newly created <tt>FlightGear-X.XX directory</tt> with e.&nbsp;g.

<p>
<tt>cd //D/FlightGear-X.XX</tt>

<p>
 and unpack the Win32 libraries there:

<p>
     <tt>pkunzip -d win32-libs-X.XX.zip</tt>.

<p>

<li>  You will find a file called <tt>install.exe</tt> in the Win32
directory after unzipping <tt>win32-libs-X.XX.zip</tt>. This
version of <tt>install.exe</tt> should replace the one in your
\<tt>H-i386-cygwin32\bin</tt> directory -
it's sole claim to fame is that it understands that when many
calls to it say <tt>install foo</tt> they mean <tt>install
foo.exe</tt>. If you skip this step and attempt an install with the
older version present <tt>make install</tt> will fail.

<p>
Side Note: We need to make a distinction between the
<tt>build tree<a NAME="build tree32">
</a></tt> and the <tt>install tree<a NAME="install tree32">
</a></tt>.
The <tt>build tree</tt> is what we've been talking about up until
this point.  This is where the source code lives and all the
compiling takes place.  Once the executables are built, they need
to be installed someplace.  We shall call this install location
the <tt>install tree</tt>.  This is where the executables, the
scenery, the textures, and any other run-time files will be
located.

<p>

<li> Configure<a NAME="Configure32">
</a> the make system for your environment and your
<tt>install tree</tt>. Tell the configure script where you would like to install the
binaries<a NAME="binaries32">
</a> and all the scenery<a NAME="scenery32">
</a> and textures<a NAME="textures32">
</a> by using the
<tt>--prefix</tt> option. In the following example the base of the <tt>install
tree</tt> is <tt>FlightGear</tt>. Make sure you are within <i>FlightGear </i>'s <tt>build tree</tt>
root directory.

<p>

<li> Run:<a NAME="configure32">
</a>

<p>
        <tt>./configure --prefix=/mnt/FlightGear</tt>.

<p>
 Side note: The make procedure is designed to link against opengl32.dll, glu32.dll, and
glut32.dll which most accelerated boards require. If this does not apply to yours or if
you installed SGI's software rendering<a NAME="software rendering32">
</a> as mentioned in Subsection <A href="#softrend">2.5</A>
you may have to change these to opengl.dll, glu.dll, and glut.dll. (In case you're in
doubt check your <tt>\windows\system</tt> directory what you've
got.)

<p>
 If this is the case for your video card<a NAME="video card32">
</a>, you can edit
 <tt>.../Simulator/Main/ Makefile</tt> and rename these three libraries to
    their "non-32" counterparts.  There is only one place in this
    <tt>Makefile</tt> where these files are listed.

<p>

<li> Build the executable.  Run:

<p>
        <tt>make</tt>.

<p>
Assuming you have installed the updated version of <tt>install.exe</tt> (see earlier
instructions) you can now create and populate the <tt>install tree</tt>.  Run:

<p>
        <tt>make install</tt>.

<p>
    You can save a significant amount of space by stripping all the
    debugging symbols off of the executable.  To do this, change to the
    directory in the <tt>install tree</tt> where your binary lives and run:

<p>
    <tt>strip fgfs.exe</tt> resp. <tt>strip fgfs-sgi.exe</tt>.

4.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing the Binaries on a Windows system</H2><a NAME="binaries+installation41">
</a>
You can skip this Section and go to the installation of scenery in case you built
<i>FlightGear </i>along the lines describes during the previous Chapter. If you did not and
you're jumping in here your first step consists in installing the binaries. At present,
there are only pre-compiled binaries<a NAME="binaries41">
</a> available for Windows 98/NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT41">
</a> while in
principle it might be possible to create (statically linked) binaries for Linux<a NAME="Linux41">
</a>
as well.

<p>
The following supposes you are on a Windows 98 or Windows NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT41">
</a> system.
Installing the binaries is quite simple. Go to

<p>
 <a href="ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Win32/">ftp://ftp.flightgear.org/pub/fgfs/Win32/</a>

<p>
 get the latest binaries from that subdirectory named

<p>
<tt>fgfs-win32-bin-X.XX.exe</tt>

<p>
 and unpack them via double clicking. This will create a directory <tt>FlightGear</tt>
with several subdirectories. You are done.

<p>
      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing Support files<a NAME="Support files42">
</a></H2>

<p>
Independent on your operating system and independent on if you built the binaries
yourself or installed the precompiled ones as described above you will need
scenery<a NAME="scenery42">
</a>, texture<a NAME="texture42">
</a>, sound<a NAME="sound42">
</a>, and some more support files. A basic
package of all these is contained in the binaries directory mentioned above as

<p>
 <tt>fgfs-base-X.XX</tt>.

<p>
  Preferably, you may want to download the <tt>.tar.gz</tt> version
if you are working under Linux<a NAME="Linux42">
</a>/UNIX<a NAME="UNIX42">
</a> and the <tt>.exe</tt> version if you
are under Windows 98/NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT42">
</a>. Make sure you get the <b>most recent</b> version.

<p>
If you're working under Linux<a NAME="Linux42">
</a> or UNIX<a NAME="UNIX42">
</a>, unpack the
previously downloaded file with

<p>
        <tt>tar xvfz fgfs-base-X.XX.tar.gz</tt>

<p>
 while under Windows 98/NT<a NAME="Windows 98/NT42">
</a> just double click on the file (being situated in the
root of your <i>FlightGear </i>drive.).

<p>
This already completes installing <i>FlightGear </i>and should you enable to invoke the
program.

<p>
Some more scenery which, however, is not a substitute for the
package mentioned above but rather is based on it can be found in
the scenery subdirectory under

<p>
 <a href="http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/">http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/</a>

<p>
 These may be older versions which may or may not work with the
most recent binaries.

<p>
In addition, there is a complete set of USA Scenery files<a NAME="USA Scenery files42">
</a>
available created by Curt Olson<a NAME="Olson, Curt42">
</a> which can be
downloaded from

<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.kingmont.com/pub/kingmont/">ftp://ftp.kingmont.com/pub/kingmont/</a>

<p>
 The complete set covers several 100's of MBytes. Thus, Curt
provides the complete set on CD-ROM for those who really would
like to fly over all of the USA. For more detail, check the
remarks in the downloads page above.

<p>
Finally, the binaries directory mentioned contains the complete <i>FlightGear </i>documentation
as

<p>
<tt>fgfs-manual-X.XX.exe</tt>.

<p>
It includes a .pdf version of this <i>Installation and Getting Started</i> guide
intended for pretty printing using Adobe's Acrobat reader being available from

<p>
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat">http://www.adobe.com/acrobat</a>

<p>
Alternatively, if for one or the other reason the batch does not work, you can open an
MS-DOS shell, change to the directory where your binary resides (typically something like
<tt>d:\FlightGear\bin</tt> where you might have to substitute
<tt>d:</tt> in favor of your <i>FlightGear </i>directory), set the environment variable with

For getting maximum performance it is highly recommended to
minimize (iconize) the non-graphics window while running

This is a description of the main systems for controlling the program and piloting the
plane: Historically, keyboard controls were developed first, and you can still control
most of the simulator via the keyboard alone. Recently, they are becoming supplemented by
several menu entries, making the interface more accessible, particularly for beginners,
and providing additional functionality. A joysticks provides a more realistic alternative
for actual piloting of the plane. Concerning instruments, there are again two
alternatives: You can use the rather advanced HUD or the emerging panel.

6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Keyboard commands</H2>

<p>
While joystick<a NAME="joystick61">
</a>s or yoke<a NAME="yoke61">
</a>s are supported as are rudder pedals, you can fly
<i>FlightGear </i>using the keyboard alone. For proper controlling via keyboard (i) the
<tt>NumLock<a NAME="NumLock61">
</a></tt> key must be switched on (ii) the <i>FlightGear </i>window must have
focus (if not, click with the mouse on the graphics window). Some of the keyboard
controls might be helpful even in case you use a joystick.

<p>
After activating <tt>NumLock</tt> the following keyboard commands<a NAME="keyboard commands61">
</a> should work:
<p>

6.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The head up display<a NAME="head up display63">
</a></H2>

<p>
At current, you have two options for reading off the main flight parameters of the plane:
The HUD<a NAME="HUD63">
</a> (<b>H</b>ead <b>U</b>p <b>D</b>isplay <a NAME="head up display63">
</a> and
the panel. Neither are HUD<a NAME="HUD63">
</a>s used in usual general aviation planes nor in civilian
ones. Rather they belong to the equipment of modern military jets. However, in view of
the fact that the panel<a NAME="panel63">
</a> despite recent progress is not yet complete the
HUD<a NAME="HUD63">
</a> may well serve as a main instrument for controlling the plane. Besides, it
might be easier to fly using this one than exploiting the panel<a NAME="panel63">
</a> and several of
the real pilots might prefer it because of combining the readouts of critical parameters
with an outside view onto the real world. (Several Cessna<a NAME="Cessna63">
</a> pilots might love to
have one, but technology is simply too expensive for implementing HUDs in general
aviation aircrafts.)
<p><br>
<p>
 
<center><img src="hud.gif"><br></center><br><p> Fig.&nbsp;3: <i>The HUD, or head up display.</i>
<p><br>
<p>
The HUD<a NAME="HUD63">
</a> shown in Fig.&nbsp;3  displays all main flight parameters of the plane. In
the center you find the pitch indicator<a NAME="pitch indicator63">
</a> (in degrees) with the aileron
indicator<a NAME="aileron
indicator63">
</a> above and the rudder indicator<a NAME="rudder indicator63">
</a> below. A corresponding scale for the
elevation<a NAME="elevation indicator63">
</a> can be found to the left of the pitch scale. On the
bottom there is a simple turn indicator<a NAME="turn indicator63">
</a>.

<p>
There are two scales at the extreme left: The inner one displays the speed<a NAME="speed63">
</a> (in
kts) while the outer one indicates position of the throttle<a NAME="throttle63">
</a>. You may recall the
Navion<a NAME="Navion63">
</a> taking off at a speed of 100 kts. The two scales on the extreme r.h.s
display your height<a NAME="height63">
</a>, i.&nbsp;e. the left one shows the height above ground while the
right of it gives that above zero, both being displayed in feet.

<p>
Besides this, the HUD<a NAME="HUD63">
</a> displays some additions information. On the upper right you
find date and time. Below, you see latitude<a NAME="latitude63">
</a> and longitude<a NAME="longitude63">
</a> of your current
position on the l.h.s and r.h.s, resp. In the lower left corner there is a number
indicating the frame rate<a NAME="frame rate63">
</a>, i.e. the number of times the picture being re-drawn
each second.

<p>
You can change color of the <b>HUD</b> using the ''H'' key. Pressing it several times
minimizes the HUD.

<p>
      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc6.4">
6.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel<a NAME="panel64">
</a></H2>

<p>
Besides the HUD<a NAME="HUD64">
</a>, <i>FlightGear </i>has a panel<a NAME="panel64">
</a> which can be activated by
pressing the ''P'' key. (It is recommended disabling the HUD then by pressing ''H''
several times.) While the panel is not yet fully complete the basic five flight
instruments<a NAME="flight
instruments64">
</a> to scan are present and working.
<p><br>
<p>
 
<center><img src="panel.gif"><br></center><br><p> Fig.&nbsp;4: <i>The panel.</i>
<p><br>
<p>
In the center you find the artificial horizon<a NAME="artificial horizon64">
</a> (attitude indicator) displaying
pitch and bank of your plane. It has pitch marks (hard to be seen in this version) as
well as bank marks at 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 degrees.

<p>
Left to the artificial horizon, you'll see the airspeed indicator<a NAME="airspeed indicator64">
</a>. Not only does
it have a speed indication in knots (recall: The Navion takes off at 100 kts) but also
several arcs showing characteristic velocity rages<a NAME="velocity rages64">
</a> you have to consider. At
first, there is a green arc indicating the normal operating range of speed with the flaps
(net yet being implemented in <i>FlightGear </i>) fully retracted. The white arc indicates the
range of speed with flaps in action. The tiny yellow arc shows a range, which should only
be used in smooth air. The upper end of it has a red radial indicating the speed never to
be exceeded.

<p>
Below the airspeed indicator you can find the turn indicator<a NAME="turn indicator64">
</a>. The airplane in the
middle indicates the roll of your plane. If the left or right wing of the plane is
aligned with one of the marks this indicates a standard turn, in which you make a full
360 degrees turn in exactly two minutes.

<p>
Below the plane, still in the turn indicator, is another instrument, called
inclinometer<a NAME="inclinometer64">
</a>. It indicates if rudder<a NAME="rudder64">
</a> and ailerons<a NAME="ailerons64">
</a> are
coordinated. During turns, you always have to operate aileron and rudder in such a way
that the ball in the tube remains centered; otherwise the plane is skidding.

<p>
To the right of the artificial horizon you find the altimeter<a NAME="altimeter64">
</a> showing the height
above sea level (not ground!). At present it is not yet working in
<i>FlightGear </i> . Below the altimeter is the vertical speed indicator<a NAME="vertical speed indicator64">
</a>
which, on the other hand, is operational. It indicates the rate of climbing or sinking of
your plane in hundreds of feet per minute.

<p>
There is one more instrument working in the panel, i.e. the second one in the column on
the r.h.s. indicating position of throttle<a NAME="throttle64">
</a>.

<p>
This completes description of the present main <i>FlightGear </i>instruments. If you are
looking for some interesting places to discover with <i>FlightGear </i>(which may or may not
require downloading additional scenery) you may want to check

<p>
 <a href="http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/Places">http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/Places</a>.

<p>
There is now a menu entry for entering directly the airport code<a NAME="airport code64">
</a> of the airport
you want to start from.

<p>
Finally, if you're done and are about to leave the plane, just hit the ESC key or use the
corresponding menu entry to exit the program.

<p>
      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc7.2">
7.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;What remains to be done</H2>
At first: If you read (and, maybe, followed) this guide until this
point you may probably agree that <i>FlightGear </i> , even
in its present state, is not at all for the birds. It is already a
flight simulator which has a flight model, a plane, terrain
scenery, texturing and simple controls.

<p>
Despite, <i>FlightGear </i>needs - and gets - further development. Except internal tweakings,
there are several fields where <i>FlightGear </i>needs basics improvement and development.

<p>
A first direction is adding airports<a NAME="airports72">
</a>, streets, and more things bringing Scenery
to real life.

<p>
Second, the panel<a NAME="panel72">
</a> needs further improvement including more working gauges.

<p>
Besides, there should be support for adding more planes<a NAME="planes72">
</a> and for implementing
corresponding flight models differing from the Navion<a NAME="Navion72">
</a>.

<p>
Another task is further implementation of the menu system<a NAME="menu system72">
</a>, which should not be
too hard with the basics being working now.

<p>
A main stream of active development concerns weather. At present there is simply none: no
clouds, no rain, no wind. But there sure will be.

<p>
There are already people working in all of these directions. If you're a programmer and
think you can contribute, you are invited to do so.

<p>

<H3>Achnowledgements</H3>
Obviously this document could not have been written without all
those contributors mentioned above making <i>FlightGear </i>a reality.

<p>
Beyond this we would like to say special thanks to Curt
Olson,<a NAME="Olson, Curt72">
</a> whose numerous scattered Readmes,
Thanks, Webpages, and personal eMails were of special help to us
and were freely exploited in the making of this booklet.

8.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;General problems</H2>

<UL>
<p>

<li><i>FlightGear </i>runs SOOO slow<br>
 If the HUD<a NAME="HUD81">
</a> indicates you are getting something like 1&nbsp;fps
 (frame per second) or below you typically don't have working hardware
 OpenGL<a NAME="OpenGL81">
</a> support. There may be several reasons for this. First,
 there may be no OpenGL hardware drivers available for older
 cards. In this case it is highly recommended to get a new board.

<p>
 Second, check if your drivers are properly installed. Several
 cards need additional OpenGL support drivers besides the
 ''native'' windows ones. For more detail check Chapter
 <A href="#opengl">2</A>.

<p>
 Third, check if your hardware driver is called <tt>opengl32.dll</tt>
 or just merely <tt>opengl.dll</tt>. By the default compilation, binaries are linked against
 <tt>open</tt> <tt>gl32.dll</tt>. If you require the non-32 version,
 consider rebuilding <i>FlightGear </i>with the libraries <tt>opengl32.dll</tt>,
 <tt>glut32.dll</tt>, and <tt>glu32.dll</tt> replaced by their
 non-32 counterparts. For more details check Chapter
 <A href="#building">3</A>.

<p>
 If you installed the pre-compiled binaries <tt>runfgfs.bat</tt> invokes
 <tt>fgfs.exe</tt> while <tt>runfgfs.sgi.bat</tt> invokes
 <tt>fgfs.sgi.exe</tt> with the first ones being linked against the 32-versions.

<p>
 Usually, hardware accelerated drivers use the 32-libraries.

<p>
 </UL>      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc8.2">
8.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential problems under Linux</H2>

<p>
Since we don't have access to all possible flavors of Linux distributions, here are some
thoughts on possible causes of problems. (This Section includes contributions by Kai
Troester <a href="mailto:Kai.Troester@rz.tu-ilmenau.de">Kai.Troester@rz.tu-ilmenau.de</a>.)

<p>

<UL>  
<li>Wrong library versions<br>
  This is a rather common cause of grief especially when you prefer to
  install the libraries needed by <i>FlightGear </i>by hand. Be sure that
  especially the Mesa library contains support for the 3DFX
    board<a NAME="3DFX
    board82">
</a> and that Glide<a NAME="Glide82">
</a> libraries are installed and can be
  found. If a <tt>ldd `which fgfs`</tt> complains about missing
  libraries you are in trouble.
  
<p>
  You should also be sure to keep <em>always the <em>latest version
  of Steve's plib on your system. Lots of people (including me) have
  failed miserably to compile <i>FlightGear </i>just because of an outdated
  plib.
  
<p>

<li>Missing permissions<a NAME="permissions82">
</a><br>
  <i>FlightGear </i>needs to be setuid root in order to be capable of
  accessing the accelerator board (or a special kernel module as
  described earlier in this document). So you can either issue a

<p>
  <tt>chown root.root /usr/local/bin/fgfs ;</tt><br>
  <tt>chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/fgfs</tt>
  
<p>
  to give the <i>FlightGear </i>binary the proper rights or install the 3DFX module. The latter is the ``clean''
  solution and strongly recommended!

<p>

<li>Non-default install options<br>
  <i>FlightGear </i>will display a lot of diagnostics when being started up.
  If it complains about bad looking or missing files, check that you
  installed them in the way they are supposed to be, i.e. latest
  version and proper location. The canonical location <i>FlightGear </i>
  wants its data files under <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt>. Be sure to
  grab the latest versions of everything that might be needed!

<p>

<li>Compile problems<br>
  Check as far as you can, as a last resort (and a great information
  source, too) there are mailing lists for which information can be
  gotten at

<p>
  <a href="http://www.flightgear.org/mail.html">http://www.flightgear.org/mail.html</a>.

<p>
This will give you direct contact to the developers.

<p>

<li>Configure could not find Mesa and Glut though they are
installed

<p>
If the configure script could not find your Mesa and Glut libraries you should add the
Mesa library-path (i.e. <tt>/usr/local/Mesa</tt>) to the EXTRA_DIRS variable in the file
configure.in (i.e. <tt>EXTRA_DIRS=''/usr/local/usr/</tt>
<tt>X11R6/usr/local/Mesa''</tt>). After this you have to run autoconf. (Please read
README.autoconf for running autoconf )

<p>

<li>SuSE Distribution

<UL>
<p>
 
<li> If you have a SuSE distribution use the egcs compiler instead
of the compiler delivered with SuSE. Grab it at

<p>
<a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com">http://egcs.cygnus.com</a>

<p>
 
<li> SuSE 6.0 users should also use the Glide,
Mesa and Glut Libraries delivered with the distribution
 
<li> A known problem of Flight Gear until version Version 0.57 with SuSE concerns
  <tt>acconfig.h</tt>. If 'make' stops and reports an error in relation with acconfig.h
insert the following lines to <tt>/usr/share/autoconf/</tt> <tt>acconfig.h</tt>:

<p>
        <tt>/* needed to compile fgfs properly*/</tt><br>
        <tt>#undef FG_NDEBUG</tt><br>
        <tt>#undef PACKAGE</tt><br>
        <tt>#undef VERSION</tt><br>
        <tt>#undef WIN32a</tt>

<p>
(a solution for this problem is coming soon )
</UL>
<p>
    Additionally there are two versions of the GNU C compiler around:
  egcs and gcc (the classic one). gcc seems to have its own notion of
  some C++ constructs, so updating to egcs won't hurt and maybe help
  to compile the program.
  
<p>
</UL>      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc8.3">
8.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential problems under Windows 98/NT</H2>

<p>

<UL>
<li>The executable refuses to run.<br>
 You may have tried to start the executable directly either by
 double-clicking <tt>fgfs.exe</tt> in Windows explorer or by invoking it
 in a MS-DOS shell. Double-clicking via explorer does never work
 (except you set the environment variable <tt>FG_ROOT</tt>
 in the autoexec.bat or otherwise). Rather double-click <tt>runfgfs.bat</tt> or
 <tt>runfgfs-sgi.bat</tt>  For more detail, check Chapter <A href="#takeoff">5</A>.

<p>
 Another potential problem might be you did not download the
 most recent versions of scenery and textures required by <i>FlightGear </i>, or
 you did not load any scenery or texture at all. Have a close look
 at this, as the scenery/texture format is still under development and may
 change frequently. For more detail, check Chapter <A href="#prefligh">4</A>.

<p>
 A further potential source of trouble are so-called
 mini-OpenGL<a NAME="mini-OpenGL83">
</a> drivers provided by some manufacturers. In this case,
 <i>FlightGear </i>'s typically hangs while opening the graphics window.
 In this case, either replace the mini-OpenGL<a NAME="mini-OpenGL83">
</a> driver by a
 full OpenGL driver or or in case such is not available install
 software OpenGL support (see Section <A href="#softrend">2.5</A>).

<p>

<li><i>FlightGear </i>ignores the command line parameters.<br>
 There is a problem with passing command line options containing a
 ''='' to windows batch files. Instead, include the options into
 <tt>runfgfs.bat</tt>.

<p>

<li>While compiling with the Cygnus Compiler <tt>Configure</tt>
complains not to find <tt>glu32.dll</tt>.

<p>
Make sure you change to the Main FlightGear directory, e.&nbsp;g. with

<p>
<tt>cd //D/FlightGear-X.XX</tt>

<p>
before running <tt>Configure</tt> and <tt>Make</tt>. Do not forget the win32 library
package.

<p>

<li>I am unable to build <i>FlightGear </i>under MSVC<a NAME="MSVC83">
</a>/MS DevStudio<a NAME="MS DevStudio83">
</a><br>
 By default, <i>FlightGear </i>is build with GNU C++, i.&nbsp;e. the
 Cygnus<a NAME="Cygnus83">
</a> compiler for Win32. For hints or Makefiles
 required for MSVC for MSC DevStudio have a look into

<p>
 <a href="http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/Source">http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/Source</a>.

<p>
In principle, <i>FlightGear </i>should be buildable with the project files provided.

<p>

<li>Compilation of <i>FlightGear </i>dies not finding <tt>gfc</tt>.

<p>
The library <tt>gfc</tt> cannot be build with the Cygnus compiler at present. It us
supposed to be substituted by something else in the future.

<p>
As the simulator is already built at this point, you simply can forget about that problem
as long as you don't intend to build the scenery creation tools<a NAME="scenery creation tools83">
</a>. Just go on with
<tt>make install</tt>.
