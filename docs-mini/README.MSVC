How to compile FlightGear with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
======================================================

FlightGear ships with MSVC project files.  That hopefully is a good start,
but these instructions really need to be filled in and updated by an MSVC 
developer.

For now, there are several MSVC developers on the FlightGear-devel mailing
list, so if you do run into problems or issues, please post your questions
there.
