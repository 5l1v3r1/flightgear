Welcome to the Flight Gear project.
===================================

The primary web page for this project is:

    http://www.menet.umn.edu/~curt/fgfs

We are overhauling the make system and a lot of things are in a state of
change, so let me know if you see incorrect information in the README's,
extraneous files laying around, or any other anomylous things.   The
coordinator of this project is Curt Olson <curt@me.umn.edu>.
