A very special thanks is due to the following people and groups.

Note, as hard as I've tried, I've found it impossible to perfectly
maintain this file.  If you are aware of someone who you think might
be included here, PLEASE let me know.  Projects like this are made
possible only by the help and hard work of others.  I want to properly
credit everyone who has contributed to this project.


Raoul Alonzo <amil@las.es>.  Mr. Alonzo is the author of Ssystem and
  provided his kind permission for using the moon texture. I also used
  parts of his code as a template when adding the texture.


Michele America <nomimarketing@mail.telepac.pt>
  Contributed to the HUD code.


Michael Basler <pmb@knUUt.de>
  Coauthor of the Getting Started guide.


Jon S. Berndt <jsb@hal-pc.org>
  Working on a complete C++ rewrite/reimplimentation of the core FDM.
  Initially he is using X15 data to test his code, but once things are
  all in place we should be able to simulator arbitrary aircraft.


Paul Bleisch <pbleisch@acm.org>
  Paul redid the "debug" system so that it would be much more
  flexible, so it could be easily disabled for production system, and
  so that messages for certain subsystems could be selectively
  enabled.

  Also contributed a first stab at a config file/command line parsing
  system.


Jim Brennan <jjb@foothill.net>
  Provided a big chunk of online space to store USA scenery for Flight Gear.

Gene Buckle <geneb@nwlink.com>
  Gene has done a lot of work getting FG to compile with the MSVC++
  compiler.  Also, he has pushed, proded, and bugged me endlessly to
  do my stuff right.  (I mean that in a good way, because sometimes
  when the little nudge in the right direction isn't working, I need
  a good hard shove.) :-)


Didier Chauveau <chauveau@math.univ-mlv.fr>
  Provided some initial code to parse the 30 arcsec DEM files found at:
