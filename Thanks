A very special thanks is due to the following people and groups.

Note, as hard as I've tried, I've found it impossible to perfectly
maintain this file.  If you are aware of someone who you think might
be included here, PLEASE let me know.  Projects like this are made
possible only by the help and hard work of others.  I want to properly
credit everyone who has contributed to this project.


Raoul Alonzo <amil@las.es>.  Mr. Alonzo is the author of Ssystem and
  provided his kind permission for using the moon texture. I also used
  parts of his code as a template when adding the texture.


Michele America <nomimarketing@mail.telepac.pt>
  Contributed to the HUD code.


Steve Baker <sbaker@link.com>
  - Author of PUI (a graphical interface written entirely on top of
    OpenGL/GLUT)
  - Contributed significantly to the basic Audio library.
  - Steve has provided an immense amount of coaching and tutelage,
    both on the subjects of flight simulation and OpenGL.  It has been
    his comments and thoughts that have prompted the implementation of
    most of the more sophisticated features of Flight Gear.


Paul Bleisch <pbleisch@acm.org>
  Paul redid the "debug" system so that it would be much more
  flexible, so it could be easily disabled for production system, and
  so that messages for certain subsystems could be selectively
  enabled.

  Also contributed a first stab at a config file/command line parsing
  system.


Jim Brennan <jjb@foothill.net>
  Provided a big chunk of online space to store USA scenery for Flight Gear.


Bernie Bright <bbright@c031.aone.net.au>
  Many C++ style, usage, and implimentation improvements.  STL portability,
  tons o' stuff. :-)


Bernhard H. Buckel <buckel@wmad95.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de>
  Contributed the README.Linux


Gene Buckle <geneb@nwlink.com>
  Gene has done a lot of work getting FG to compile with the MSVC++
  compiler.  Also, he has pushed, proded, and bugged me endlessly to
  do my stuff right.  (I mean that in a good way, because sometimes
  when the little nudge in the right direction isn't working, I need
  a good hard shove.) :-)


Didier Chauveau <chauveau@math.univ-mlv.fr>
  Provided some initial code to parse the 30 arcsec DEM files found at:
  http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/gtopo30/gtopo30.html


Jean-Francois Doue
  Vector 2D, 3D, 4D and Matrix 3D and 4D inlined C++ classes.  (Based on
  Graphics Gems IV ed. Paul S. Heckbert)

Francine Evans <evans@cs.sunysb.edu>
  http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~evans/stripe.html
  Wrote the @#$@#$@% GPL'd tri-striper we use and "love". :-)


Oscar Everitt <bigoc@premier.net>
  Created single engine piston engine sounds as part of an F4U package
  for FS98.  They are pretty cool and Oscar was happy to contribute
  them to our little project.


Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler <zlib@quest.jpl.nasa.gov>
  Authors of the zlib library.  Used for on-the-fly compression and
  decompression routines.

Thomas Gellekum <tg@ihf.rwth-aachen.de>
  Changes and updates for compiling on FreeBSD


Jeff Goeke-Smith <jgoeke@voyager.net>
  Contributed our first autopilot.  (Heading Hold)
  Better autoconf check for external timezone/daylight variables in 
  #include <time.h>


Michael I. Gold <gold@puck.asd.sgi.com> -- Patiently answered my endless
  "newbie" OpenGL questions.  His effort alone has made me a great SGI
  fan.


Charlie Hotchkiss <chotchkiss@namg.us.anritsu.com> -- Worked on improving
  and enhancing the HUD code.  Lots of code style tips and code tweaks ...


Bruce Jackson of NASA <e.b.jackson@larc.nasa.gov> 
  http://agcbwww.larc.nasa.gov/People/ebj.html -- Developed the
  LaRCsim code under funding by NASA which we use to provide the 
  flight model.  Bruce has patiently answered my many, many questions.


Tom Knienieder <knienieder@ms.netwing.at>
  Ported Steve's Audio library to Win32


Reto Koradi <kor@mol.biol.ethz.ch> http://www.mol.biol.ethz.ch/~kor
  Helped me get on track with setting up fog effects.


Bob Kuehne <rpk@sgi.com>
  Redid the Makefile system so it is simpler and more robust.


Vasily Lewis <vlewis@woodsoup.org>  http://www.woodsoup.org
  Provided computing resources and services so that the Flight Gear 
  project could have real home.  This includes, web services, ftp services
  shell accounts, email lists, dns services, etc.


Eric Mitchell <mitchell@mars.ark.com>
  Contributed some topnotch scenery textures.


Anders Morken <amrken@online.no>
  Maintains the European mirror of the FG web pages.


Alan Murta <amurta@cs.man.ac.uk>
  http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/aig/staff/alan/software/
  Created the Generic Polygon Clipping library


Friedemann Reinhard <mpt218@faupt212.physik.uni-erlangen.de>
  Contributed beginnings of a textured instrument panel.


Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@games.no>
  Incorporated the Gnu automake/autoconf system (with libtool).
  This should streamline and standardize the build process for all
  Unix-like platforms.  It should have little effect on IDE type 
  environments since the don't use the Unix make system.


William Riley <riley@technologist.com>
  Contributed code to add "brakes".


Paul Schlyter <pausch@saaf.se>.  Mr. Schlyter provided Durk Talsma with 
  all the information he needed to write the astro code.


Chris Schoeneman <crs@millpond.engr.sgi.com>
  Contributed some 3d sound playing code for Irix, Win32, and Linux
  It is unclear if this code will be used directly, but it certainly
  will have an influence on the development of our own audio library.


Jonathan R Shewchuk <Jonathan_R_Shewchuk@ux4.sp.cs.cmu.edu>
  Author of the Triangle program.  Triangle is used to calculate the
  Delauney triangulation of our irregular terrain.


Gordan Sikic <gsikic@public.srce.hr>
  Contributed a cherokee flight model for LaRCsim.  Currently is not
  working and needs to be debugged.  Use configure --with-flight-model=cherokee
  to build the cherokee instead of the navion.


Michael Smith <msmith99@flash.net>
  Contributed cockpit graphics, 3d models, logos, and other images.
  Project Bonanza - http://members.xoom.com/ConceptSim/index.html

  Provided geographic data used by this project


Durk Talsma <pn_talsma@macmail.psy.uva.nl>
  Accurate Sun, Moon, and Planets.  Sun changes color based on
  position in sky.  Moon has correct phase and blends well into the
  sky.  Planets are correctly positioned and have proper magnitude.


Gary R. Van Sickle <tiberius@braemarinc.com>
  Contributed some initial GameGLUT support and other fixes.


Carmelo Volpe <carmelo.volpe@csb.ki.se>
  Porting Flight Gear to the Metro Works development environment (PC/Mac)


Robert Allan Zeh <raz@cmg.FCNBD.COM>
  Helped me tremendously in figuring out the Cygnus win32 compiler and
  how to link with .dll's.  With out him the first runable win32
  version of FG would have been impossible.
