You need to have the GFC library installed on your system to build
some of the scenery generation tools, otherwise, some of the tools will fail
to build.

    http://www.geog.psu.edu/~qian/gfc/index.html

I recommend you grab a copy with a couple modifications I have made
which should eliminate several gfc build problems:
