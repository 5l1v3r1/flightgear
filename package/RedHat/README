This directory contains the files which, along with
the source code tar files, can be used to build
an RPM package targeted at a Red Hat Linux system.

To build flighgear from source do the following:

0.	be root on your system (actually it's possible to
	build from source as a non-root user but
	I won't go into that now).

1.	copy flightgear.spec to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/

2.	copy flightgear.48.png to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES

3.	copy flightgear.desktop to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES

4.	obtain fgfs-base-0.9.3.tar.gz and FlightGear-0.9.3.tar.gz
	and copy them into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.

5.	obtain and install SimGear (>= 0.3.4).

6.	look in the BuildRequires section of flightgear.spec
	and check that all the packages referred to are
	installed.

7.	cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	rpmbuild -ba flightgear.spec

that's it.
