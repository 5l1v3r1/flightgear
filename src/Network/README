Network README
--------------
Here in .../Simulator/Network will be the new home for multi pilot
related code.
For the moment all you get is a new menu entry "Network" with the
folowing entries:

- Hyper Blast            : Toggles between LaRCsim and a tuned Flight-Model
                           you can change between both "on the fly "
- Toggle Display         : enable/disable info (Lat/Lon/Alt) about found player
                           well, by now it will be you. ;-))
- Display Netinfos       : n.i. will display more detailed information
- Enter Callsign         : to enter your name
- Scan for Deamons       : n.i. will scan the network for FGFS_D's
- Register to FGD        : n.i. will allow pilot to connect to found Deamons
- Show Pilots            : n.i. ? not yet sure what to show, maybe their planes
- Send Message           : n.i. will send a message to a specific Pilot
- Send Message to all    : n.i. obvious, isn't it ?
- Unregister from Deamon : n.i. 

In the Tools directory you will find some progs (one first try of deamon)
to play with. There is also a README file, check it out.

You don't need a net-access to test this new stuff since it is just an idea
of how to incorporate a Multi-Pilot Mode in FGFS.

There are two security options:
a) Compiletime - commenting the "#define FG_NETWORK_OLK" in "network.h" 
   disables ALL network related stuff in case of problems, shouldn't occur ;-)
b) Runtime - setting the "int net_hud_display" variable to 0 disables any
   network display (default)
