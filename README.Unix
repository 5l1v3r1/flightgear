If you are reading this in hopes that you will find the answer to a
specific question, please send the question to curt@me.umn.edu and
suggest that I include the answer here.


Compilers and Portability
=========================

Flight Gear is known to build with egcs-1.1 and higher, as well as
gcc-2.8 and higher.  Your mileage may vary with earlier versions of
these compilers although support for gcc-2.7.x is mostly there.

For other platforms where you may have access to native compilers,
again your mileage may vary.  We would like to support as many
different compilers and platforms as possible.  Please relay any
changes you make (or problems you encounter) back to
curt@flightgear.org, so that in the future we can better support your
platform and your compiler.  I have access to a few different
platforms, but I must depend on others to make sure their favorite
platform and compiler is well supported.


GLUT
====

Flight Gear requires GLUT version 3.7 or later (aka GameGLUT._ GLUT
needs to be installed on your system before you can build Flight Gear.
GLUT can be found at:

    http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html

GLUT (pronounced like the glut in gluttony) is the OpenGL Utility
Toolkit, a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL
programs. It implements a simple windowing application programming
interface (API) for OpenGL. GLUT makes it considerably easier to learn
about and explore OpenGL programming.  GLUT provides a portable API so
you can write a single OpenGL program that works on both Win32 PCs and
X11 workstations.


Joystick Support
================

GLUT only has win32 joystick support but even at that, it is not well
implimented.  So we use Steve Backer's joystick library when possible,
and fall back to GLUT for win32 until Steve's library adds win32
support.

To make sure joystick support is included when building under Linux:

  - make sure you have the proper joystick module installed.
  - make sure the proper devices are created in /dev.
  - /usr/include/linux/joystick.h must exist on your system.
