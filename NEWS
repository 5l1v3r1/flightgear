* Added a command line option to specify --fg-root which will override
  $FG_ROOT
* Hard coded default locations for FG_ROOT for situations when nothing
  is specified.  Unix = /usr/local/lib/FlightGear  Win32 = \FlightGear
* Restructured the command line processing code so that it can process
  these sames comands (one per line) out of a config file.
* Added a command line option to specify field of view.  This is
  adjustable at run time using "X / x".  Supporting code contributed
  by Norman Vine.

New in 0.46:
* Complete C++ re-write of the HUD section.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes and tweaks.

New in 0.45:
* Added an option to enable/disable wireframe rendering.
* Added an option to enable/disable fog/haze.
* Added an option to enable/disable sky blending.
* Added an option to select smooth/flat polygon shading.
* Added an option to enable full-screen mode.
* Added a visual frame rate counter on the HUD.  (Contributed by Durk Talsma)
* Autopilot updates (Jeff Goeke-Smith)
* Added an option to control the number of neighboring tiles that are drawn

New in 0.44: 
* Fixed a horible bug that cause the time to be *WAY* off when
  compiling with the CygWin32 compiler.
* Wrap up zlib so we can conditionally compile back in normal behavior
  on systems that have trouble building zlib.
* Minor adjustment to texture coordinate generation to reduce texture
  swimming.
* Added a command line option to enable/disable texture maps
* Minor transformation adjustments to try to keep scenery tiles closer
  to (0, 0, 0) GLfloats run out of precision at the distances we need
  to model the earth, but we can do a bunch of pre-transformations
  using double floats and then cast to GLfloat once everything is
  close in where we have less precision problems.
* command line option to set starting position by airport ID
* Cleaned up initialization sequence to eliminate interdependencies
  between sun position, lighting, and view position.  This creates a
  valid single pass initialization path.  
* use already calculated LaRCsim values to create the roll/pitch/yaw
  transformation matrix

New in 0.43:
* material properties bug fixed when rendering terrain.
* bug in sky color generation fixed.
* bug in fog color generation fixed.
* zlib on the fly decompression/compression support.
* more code reorganization and clean ups.
* a fixed up 30 arcsec DEM file preprocessor.  World wide DEM's are 
  available in this format.

New in 0.42:
* Simple autopilot heading hold contributed by 
  Jeff Goeke-Smith <jgoeke@voyager.net>
* More code reorganization and clean ups.

New in 0.41:
* Many autoconf cleanups and tweaks
* make and make install work in unix
* make works for cygnus win32 (but not install yet)
* make dist now works
* added the Tools directory into the main source tree

New in 0.40:
* Gnu automake/autoconf/libtool make system
* Initial texture support
* Bug fixes
