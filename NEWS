* Added an entirely new set of flight dynamics modeling code by Andy Ross.
  Includes several aircraft such as a 747, A4, and DC-3.
  This is (Y)et (A)nother Flight Dynamics (Sim)ulator.  It is a first cut
  of a "different take" on FDM design.  It's intended to be very simple
  to use, producing reasonable results for aircraft of all sorts and sizes,
  while maintaining simulation plausibility even in odd flight conditions
  like spins and aerobatics.  It's at the point now where one can
  actually fly the planes around.
* Added an optional embedded http server that provides a property
  manager interface to external programs and scripts.

* Added 'master freeze' and 'fuel freeze' modes.  Would like to add
  other freeze modes soon.
* Added a 'high' level aircraft config file that specifies things like
  the FDM code to use, the aircraft config file, the 3d model, the
  instrument panel, autopilot config, etc.
* Added a neat external 'chase' view control panel.
* Added a GUI interface to the property manager system.

  from the instrument panel. 
* Fixed a bug when loading the "old" binary scenery which prevented ground
  lighting from being generated.
* Jettison old conditionally compiled plib-1.2.x code, we now require
  plib-1.4.x or higher.
* Eliminated some convoluted that generated a harmless, but confusing
  "*** NO TIMEZONE" error message,

  with atmospheric and velocity dependencies.  Fuel flow now modeled.
* Straightened out magnetic offset issues with VOR stations so we can
  navigate properly from real avaition charts.
* Added a direct network interface support for the "Atlas" moving map
  program.  (Output radio stack settings so current VOR and OBS can be

* Improvements to flight model initialization.
* Fixes and improvements to the save/restore code.
* Added a load/save dialog box for saving/restoring your current flight.

  higher resultion textures if they are available and if you can use
  them.
* Added a visibility= command line option for setting intial visibility
  distance.

  pre-ssg days, and majorly overhauled it.
* Complete reengineering of the panel code in preparation for moving the
  configuration out into a data file.
* Lots of hashing around with Joystick support trying to achieve something
  that is flexible enough to handle the zillions of possible configurations
  out there.  Hopefully we are approaching a workable solution.
* Better windows support in our joystick module.
* View code simplifications and optimizations contributed by Norman Vine.

* Added support for $FG_SCENERY and --fg-scenery=path so scenery can have a
  different location from the base package.

  level communications modules over to simgear.
* Replaced gdbm with metakit
* Added David Megginson's property manager


New in 0.7.3

  remote joystick connected to another machine.  This is in support of
  some custom hardware located in the human factors research lab of the
  university of minnesota.
* HUD controls are a bit different "h" toggles through day/night/off
  modes and "H" cycles through brightness levels.
* Norman Vine contributed code to optionally do antialiased hud lines
  on hardware that supports this.  Norman also contributed additional
  hud cleanups and updates.
* Updates to JSBsim flight dynamics code that includes a generic
  reconfigurable flight control system, a initial state trimming routine,
  support for wind and weather, support for flaps, independent trim control,
  config files changes
* Updates to LaRCsim flight dynamcis code contributed by UIUC that
  allows loading aircraft specifications at runtime from config files.
  UIUC is using flightgear as a platform to do icing research.  The UIUC
  aircraft use the c172 gear model for now which causes some weirdness
  on the ground for some of the larger aircraft.
* Flight model no longer has to be chosen at compile time.
* Separated ephemeris code from the actual sky rendering code and gave
  this whole section a big overhaul.  The moon should now consistantly
  have the correct phase.
* Rebuilt the sky dome using ssg.
* Removed dependencies on mat3.h and friends (old srgp support lib)
* Airport lookups now done through gdbm (a light weight embedded database.)
* Converted ssgVTable's to ssgVtxTables which do proper memory
  management and should facilitate use of compiled vertex arrays once
  ssg add support for these.

* Use a more standard texture/blend mode combination for sun/moon halos to
  avoid render path that's not supported by all cards/drivers.
* Change reported speed on hud from V_equiv_kts to V_calibrated_kts
* Instrument panel rewrite by David Megginson.  This isn't quite as flashy
  as the first pass, but is much more functional, plays much better with 
  opengl, and it should be relatively easy for someone with graphical skills
  to make it look more spiffy.
* MacOS fixes contributed by Darrell Walisser.
* Many JSBsim updates.
* Added a screen snapshot facility (F3).
* Added a load/save state function contributed by David Megginson.
* Added support for various I/O protocols and channels so that flightgear
  can communicate with itself and other programs through a variety of means.
* Bug fix:  The aircraft model used for external views was being included in 
  the height above terrain check so when the view position and the aircraft
  model collided the current altitude kept getting pushed up to compensate,
  but of course the aircraft model would get pushed up as well because it
  tracks the current aircraft position and orientation.  Thus you had a never
  ending cycle ...
* Oliver's multiplayer network code now moved to his own subdirectory:
  NetworkOLK
* Added simulated cloud puffs as we pass through the cloud layer.
* Cleaned up some memory leaks occuring between ssg and flightgear.

  meter too high (and regenerated the world scenery with proper elevations.)
* Updates to JSBsim.
* Added support for a pilot view offset from the center of gravity.
* Various platform portability fixes.
* Updated time-offset/syncing command line options.
* Updated the FDM <==> Flight Gear interface to be more object oriented.
  This should hopefully pave the way for being able to simulate several
  concurrent entities.

* Various scenery tools changes and enhancements in preparation for adding
  runways (hopefully for the next release.)

New in 0.7.0
* Autopilot can now fly great circle routes.

  options for setting the starting time of the sim.
* We now draw nonexistant tiles as ocean which means we only have to create
  and distribute tiles that contain some sort of land mass.

* Now expect plib to be installed in it's one true and official location.
* Added support for timegm() if it exists which explicitely expects GMT input.

  shapelib which has been added into the Tools tree.
* Added support for the wonderful GSHHS global land mass data set.
* Removed dependecy on process-dem.pl script.
* Created a new distributed/parallel tile build system ... hmmm kind of super
  computer or beowulf style stuff for getting large chunks of scenery built
  as fast as possible.
* Only generate tiles that have land mass data since the sim can recreate pure
  ocean tiles on the fly.
* First stab at a water flattening scheme to prevent oceans, lakes, and rivers
  from running up and down the sides of hills.
* Changed the default "Work/" subdirectory layout.
* Updates to better handle segment boundaries in preparation for real airport
  runway and lighting modeling.

  20 machines in parallel, scenery for the entire USA can be regenerated in
  just over 4 hours vs. 70+ hours on a single machine.
* Texture scale can be specified (and changed)( in the materials file.  The
  sim must be rerun for the change to take effect.
* Windows now uses plib joystick code so rudder pedals should now work.
* Now builds against Steve Baker's plib (portable game devel library) 
  distributed separately (www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/plib/)

* "Just in time" texture loading to reduce initial sim loading time.


New in 0.59 (This is an intermediate/stepping stone release.  Skip this 
             release if you are interested in stability.)
* IRIX portability changes and support for native SGI compilers.
* Solaris portability tweaks

  yet complete.)
* Changes to allow adjustment of the autopilot settings while it is
  activated.
* Began complete overhaul of scenery generation tools.

  the author has explicitely refused our request to distribute source code
  for this library with Flight Gear.
* updated installation and getting started guide
* switched to a simpler, lighter weight frame rate calculation method.
* new tile division scheme.

* Renamed Simulator/Flight to Simulator/FDM
* Tweaks to assist building FGFS on solaris platforms.
* Moved Lib/DEM to Tools/DEM
* Started preparations for scenery generation tools overhaul.
* More MSVC++ support.
* Removed code that made the sun bigger at the horizon since this is just
  an optical illusion in real life.
* Bug fixed so that the sim can start out at an airport below sea level.

New in 0.57
* Converted to a simpler frame rate counting method.
* Fixed the AOA reading on the HUD.
* Removed gpc from the Lib section of distribution by request of the
  gpc Author.  The gpc license is unfortunately not compatible with
  the GPL.  I may look for an alternative library, or just require
  that developers download this library separately.
* First slew of changes from the MacOS porting effort contributed by
 "Robert Puyol" <puyol@abvent.fr>.
* Support for an arbitrary number of serial ports + additional serial port 
  output tweaks.

* Portability enhancements for Borland, Solaris, and SGI.
* Some internal class renaming and reorganizations.  fgFLIGHT becomes FGState.
  fgCONTROLS becomes FGControls.
* Started work on an "external" flight model so the sim can be driven from
  external input (serial port, network, file, etc.)
* Fixed a problem that creeped in with setting the initial startup altitude.
  This could cause an unrecoverable bounce and you'd end up flipped on your
  back.  Should be fixed now.
* Sun now appears to grow in size as it gets very low in the horizon.
* Fixed a view frustum culling bug where the scene was not accurately culled
  when your view was anything other than straight forward.

New in 0.56
* Changed default HUD units to the more standard feet units.  You can still
  use meters by specifying the command line option "--units-meters".
* Added some initial joystick support using Steve's joystick interface class.
  This works great under Linux, but Steve's class now needs to be ported to
  Windoze and other platforms.
* Also added a fall back to the GLUT joystick routines for windows (until
  we can find better joystick support.)
* Added some initial serial port support for acting like gps and outputing 
  nmea data such that could be fed into a flight map software package.
* Miscellaneous code clean ups, portability improvements, and optimizations.
* Switched to a streams based error/debug logging system that can be
  completely stripped out for a release build (./configure --without-logging)
* Support for cygwin32 b20 compiler (latest release)
* Continued progress on instrument panel
* Support for starting fgfs at higher resolutions.

New in 0.55
* New version of gpc (generic polygon clipping library) from 
  http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/aig/staff/alan/software/
* Brakes (use "b" to toggle)
* Added an altitude hold module to the autopilot.  Lock your current altitude
  with "ctrl-a", "cntr-a" again will deactivate.  (Also lock your current 
  heading with "ctrl-h", and again to deactivate.)

* Textured moon, and rewritten/restructured Astro code.
* More optimizations and code cleanups.  (Norman Vine, Bernie Bright, Charlie
  Hotchkiss.)
* Bug fixed that was causing odd display artifacts due to a degenerate
  fragment being created for every tile.
* Bug fixed that caused scenery generation to go bad (misplaced fclose on an
  invalid file descriptor.)
* Code changes to support g++ 2.7 STL (from Bernie Bright)

New in 0.53
* Some initial "GameGLUT" support contributed by Gary R. Van Sickle
  (tiberius@braemarinc.com)
* Tracked down and eliminated some memory access type bugs that were
  causing segfaults on some platforms, with some compilers using various
  optimization flags.
* Assorted code optimizations submitted by Norman Vine.
* Renamed fg -> fgfs
* Shuffled files.  
  - Created a new directory Simulator/Airports/ to handle airport data 
    specific tasks 
  - Created Simulator/Object/ to handle basic rendering objects
* Panel code update from Friedemann Reinhard (use --enable-panel to activate)
* Contributions from Bernie Bright
  - Created some new classes to enable pointers-to-functions and
    pointers-to-class-methods to be treated like objects.  These objects
    can be registered with fgEVENT_MGR.
  - File "Include/fg_callback.hxx" contains the callback class defns.
  - Modified fgEVENT and fgEVENT_MGR to use the callback classes.  Also
    some minor tweaks to STL usage.
  - Added file "Include/fg_stl_config.h" to deal with STL portability
    issues.  Added an initial config for egcs (and probably gcc-2.8.x).
    Don't have access to Visual C++ so I've left that for someone else.
  - This file is influenced by the stl_config.h file delivered with egcs.
  - Added "Include/auto_ptr.hxx" which contains an implementation of the
    STL auto_ptr class which is not provided in all STL implementations
    and is needed to use the callback classes.
  - Deleted fgLightUpdate() which was just a wrapper to call
    fgLIGHT::Update().
  - Modified fg_init.cxx to register two method callbacks in place of the
    old wrapper functions.
  - The new classes in libmisc.tgz define a stream interface into zlib.       
    I've put these in a new directory, Lib/Misc.  Feel free to rename it      
    to something more appropriate.  However you'll have to change the         
    include directives in all the other files.  Additionally you'll have      
    add the library to Lib/Makefile.am and Simulator/Main/Makefile.am.        
                                                                              
    The StopWatch class in Lib/Misc requires a HAVE_GETRUSAGE autoconf        
    test so I've included the required changes in config.tgz.                 
                                                                              
    There are a fair few changes to Simulator/Objects as I've moved           
    things around.  Loading tiles is quicker but thats not where the delay    
    is.  Tile loading takes a few tenths of a second per file on a P200       
    but it seems to be the post-processing that leads to a noticeable         
    blip in framerate.  I suppose its time to start profiling to see where    
    the delays are.                                                           
                                                                              
    I've included a brief description of each archives contents.              
                                                                              
    Lib/Misc/
      zfstream.cxx
      zfstream.hxx
        C++ stream interface into zlib.
        Taken from zlib-1.1.3/contrib/iostream/.
        Minor mods for STL compatibility.
        There's no copyright associated with these so I assume they're
        covered by zlib's.

      fgstream.cxx
      fgstream.hxx
        FlightGear input stream using gz_ifstream.  Tries to open the
        given filename.  If that fails then filename is examined and a
        ".gz" suffix is removed or appended and that file is opened.

      stopwatch.hxx
        A simple timer for benchmarking.  Not used in production code.
        Taken from the Blitz++ project.  Covered by GPL.

      strutils.cxx
      strutils.hxx
        Some simple string manipulation routines.

    Simulator/Airports/
      Load airports database using fgstream.
      Changed fgAIRPORTS to use set<> instead of map<>.
      Added bool fgAIRPORTS::search() as a neater way doing the lookup.
      Returns true if found.

    Simulator/Astro/
      Modified fgStarsInit() to load stars database using fgstream.

    Simulator/Objects/
      Modified fgObjLoad() to use fgstream.
      Modified fgMATERIAL_MGR::load_lib() to use fgstream.
      Many changes to fgMATERIAL.
      Some changes to fgFRAGMENT but I forget what!

New in 0.52
* Stars added in 8 stages as sky gets darker for a smoother more realistic
  transition.
* rewrote star loader to significantly improve load times.
* Tweaked sky brightness and dawn/dusk colors.
* Fixed a small problem with moon rendering.
* Fog color tries to track the sky color at the center of view in sunrise
  and sunset situations.
* Optimizations from Norman Vine
* Code fixes and tweaks from Charlie Hotchkiss.
* Added an --enable/disable-sound option.
* Added a pause key "p"
* Added command line options to specify initial position and orientation.
* Added command line option to start in paused or unpaused state.

New in 0.51
* Translucent menus
* Various HUD intensities so you can find something that is readable for the
  current conditions and lighting.
* Tie visibility to far clip plane & view frustum culling so reducting
  visibility can increase frame rates by increasing what is culled.
* Fixed stupid bug with misplaced initial position.
* Hopefully fixed a bug when parsing system.fgfsrc on windoze.

New in 0.50
* HUD updates from Charlie Hotchkiss (ladder number rotate w/ ladder, control
  position indicators are back)
* Only draw the PUI cursor if Mesa/Glide/Fullscreen.
* Added mipmapping.
* Calculate the model view transformation matrix once per tile per iteration.
  Then glLoadMatrixd() it for each fragment rather than calling push(), 
  translate(), pop().
* Added a basic splash screen.
* Added support for switching between fullscreen and window mode for 
  Mesa/3dfx/glide.
* added an enable/disable splash screen option
* added an enable/disable intro music option
* added an enable/disable instrument panel option
* added an enable/disable mouse pointer option
* Ground collision detection.  You can now land or test for collision with
  any scenery surface.
* Converted angle of attack scale into a radio altimeter.

New in 0.49
* Managment of multiple textures
* Incorporated Friedemann Reinhard's initial panel code.
* Fog mode is now GL_FOG_EXP2 instead of GL_FOG_LINEAR
* Build the non-shared pieces of the FG sim as static libs.

New in 0.48
* Incorporated Steve Baker's PUI user interface library written
  entirely on top of OpenGL
* Incorporated Steve Baker's Audio library which currently only
  supports Linux, but a win32 port is very close to being done.
* Sort object fragments by material property before rendering.  This
  will be a big help to performance when we start including objects
  with a wide variety of material properties and textures.
* Overlapped scenery tiles to reduce the chance of an occasional
  floating point precission induced gaps.
* Fixed a bug in zlib exposed by Borland Win32 compiler.
* Impose a maximum triangle area during scenery generation so even
  very flat areas will get split into a few smaller sub triangles.
* Fine grained (fragment level) view frustum culling.
* view transformation optimizations -- Norman Vine.
* Fixed polygon winding problem in scenery generation, so all
  tri-strips are wound counter clockwise (opengl default).

New in 0.47
* Course (per tile) view frustum culling.
* Added a command line option to specify --fg-root which will override
  $FG_ROOT
* Hard coded default locations for FG_ROOT for situations when nothing
  is specified.  Unix = /usr/local/lib/FlightGear  Win32 = \FlightGear
* Restructured the command line processing code so that it can process
  these sames comands (one per line) out of a config file.
* Added a command line option to specify field of view.  This is
  adjustable at run time using "X / x".  Supporting code contributed
  by Norman Vine.

New in 0.46:
* Complete C++ re-write of the HUD section.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes and tweaks.

New in 0.45:
* Added an option to enable/disable wireframe rendering.
* Added an option to enable/disable fog/haze.
* Added an option to enable/disable sky blending.
* Added an option to select smooth/flat polygon shading.
* Added an option to enable full-screen mode.
* Added a visual frame rate counter on the HUD.  (Contributed by Durk Talsma)
* Autopilot updates (Jeff Goeke-Smith)
* Added an option to control the number of neighboring tiles that are drawn

New in 0.44: 
* Fixed a horible bug that cause the time to be *WAY* off when
  compiling with the CygWin32 compiler.
* Wrap up zlib so we can conditionally compile back in normal behavior
  on systems that have trouble building zlib.
* Minor adjustment to texture coordinate generation to reduce texture
  swimming.
* Added a command line option to enable/disable texture maps
* Minor transformation adjustments to try to keep scenery tiles closer
  to (0, 0, 0) GLfloats run out of precision at the distances we need
  to model the earth, but we can do a bunch of pre-transformations
  using double floats and then cast to GLfloat once everything is
  close in where we have less precision problems.
* command line option to set starting position by airport ID
* Cleaned up initialization sequence to eliminate interdependencies
  between sun position, lighting, and view position.  This creates a
  valid single pass initialization path.
* use already calculated LaRCsim values to create the roll/pitch/yaw
  transformation matrix

New in 0.43:
* material properties bug fixed when rendering terrain.
* bug in sky color generation fixed.
* bug in fog color generation fixed.
* zlib on the fly decompression/compression support.
