New in 0.44: 
* Minor adjustment to texture coordinate generation to reduce texture
  swimming.
* Added an option to enable/disable texture maps
* Minor transformation adjustments to try to keep scenery tiles closer
  to (0, 0, 0) GLfloats run out of precision at the distances we need
  to model the earth, but we can do a bunch of pre-transformations
  using double floats and then cast to GLfloat once everything is
  close in where we have less precision problems.
* command line option to set starting position by airport ID
* Cleaned up initialization sequence to eliminate interdependencies
  between sun position, lighting, and view position.  This creates a
  valid single pass initialization path.  
* use already calculated LaRCsim values to create the roll/pitch/yaw
  transformation matrix

New in 0.43:
* material properties bug fixed when rendering terrain.
* bug in sky color generation fixed.
* bug in fog color generation fixed.
* zlib on the fly decompression/compression support.
* more code reorganization and clean ups.
* a fixed up 30 arcsec DEM file preprocessor.  World wide DEM's are 
  available in this format.
