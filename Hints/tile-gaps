It's a problem that plagues us too.

I can't say that I have a magic solution.

One thing I have *considered* is to do everything in integers (for
the terrain skin at least).

This sounds counter-intuitive - but the source data for your
terrain is certainly not accurate to better than a meter - and
integers have the huge advantage that they don't suffer from
roundoff error providing all you do is add and subtract them.

However, I havn't had the nerve to try this yet - right now, we
kludge the edges of each terrain tile to make it a teeny-tiny bit
too big. The resulting overlap is very small - but enough to get
rid of the cracks.

But that translate could be done in integer meters.

Nope - it's a continual problem for me too.
