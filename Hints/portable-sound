I'm willing to donate the sound code from bzflag.  It's supports:

  arbitrary number of simultaneous sounds (limited by CPU speed)
  attenuation with distance
  propagation delay
  doppler effects
  stereo panning

It runs in a separate thread and has a very simple interface.  I have
it running on Windows 95/NT and Irix, and Daryll Strauss ported it to
Linux.  The Windows version would work better if DirectSound didn't
suck so bad, but it works reasonably well now.

A drawback is that it can suck up a lot of CPU time since it has to
do its own filtering and mixing.  It also needs support for a better
HRTF, reverb with distance, high-frequency rolloff with distance, and
a way to set the volume on individual sounds.  That last one is trivial
but the others are more involved.

Mark, you interested?  I've also got fullscreen and resolution changing
code for Irix.

Cheers,
-chris

Hmm, it's not a perfect match.  Most of your sounds are purely local,
so you don't need the stereo panning, propagation delay, and doppler
effect.  However, that's no reason not to try it!

Ripping my sound code out from bzflag shouldn't be too much work
but I'm really busy at the moment.  Could you wait about a week?

BTW, as far as licensing goes I'd just want the copyright notice to
stay on the source files (we'll have to tweek the legal notice) and
a mention in the credits, if you have a credits list.  A right to
use enhancements to the code would be cool, too.

It does/should.  bzflag doesn't use this code though so it may suffer
from bit rot.  I used it to test the Doppler effect.

There may also be some issues around having a very large world.  Imagine
the sound as a spherical shell.  Outside the shell, sound hasn't reached
you yet;  inside the shell, the sound has passed by.  In bzflag I need
to keep sounds around for as long as any part of the shell is inside the
world because it's possible to move from one place to another instantly.
Seems to me you have this same situation if you want external views.

The sound engine is clever enough not to process sounds unless you're in
the shell, so a large world probably won't cause any problems.  I'm just
not sure at the moment.

Should be fine.  I've no problem releasing my code under the GPL.

Actually, it's already got accurate sun, moon, and stars.  The star
magnitudes are relatively okay (there's not enough dynamic range on
a monitor anyway).  You can specify any position on the earth, and
the positions are accurately based on the time and date.  Great minds
think alike, eh?

I don't have the planets as I thought I'd gone overboard myself.  Guess
I hadn't gone far enough!

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


I am pleased to announce the preliminary release of the 
Enlightened Sound Daemon (EsounD version 0.2) for Linux.  
More details at <URL:http://www.netcom.com/~ericmit/EsounD.html>.
This program is designed to mix together several digitized 
audio streams for playback by a single device.  The current 
list of features includes the following functionality:

 o  A simple authentication scheme is implemented.  The first
    process to present a 16 byte key to the daemon determines
    the ownership of the daemon.  The owner of the daemon may
    allow or disallow connections from other keys.  If a HUP
    signal is received, ownership of the daemon is reset.

 o  Playback of multiple digital samples simultaneously is 
    supported.  The daemon uses a raw sample format which 
    is easily generated by the SOX utility from many other 
    data formats.

 o  The mixed audio data may be output from the daemon as a
    "monitor" stream.

 o  Recording from the current input of the sound device is
    supported.  Full duplex operation (simultaneous recording
    and playback) is supported.

 o  Client connections may cache samples for playback by an 
    assigned identification number.  For example, a window
    manager may cache samples in the server for playback on
    various events, and play them back without replaying the
    full audio stream for the sample.  Samples may be looped
    until the server receives a "stop sample" message. 

Currently, the only platform supported is Linux.  It is intended
that this program support multiple platforms.  I have limited
access to other Unix platforms, so any help in porting the
Enlightened Sound Daemon to other platforms is appreciated.  
The amp program, by Tomislav Uzelac may be a good reference 
for porting the audio interface to other platforms.

This is to be considered an alpha release, as functionality
remains to be implemented.
