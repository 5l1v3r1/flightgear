  Return TRUE if this machine is little endian,
  FALSE otherwise.

int is_little_endian ()
{
  int i = 1 ;

  return *((char *) &i) ;
}

...this works because the address of an integer on a little-endian machine is
the address of the low order byte (whose value is 1) and on a big-endian machine,
it's the address of the high order byte (whose value is 0).
