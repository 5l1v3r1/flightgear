Well, if you can do it with glFrustum then you can do it with
gluPerspective. Note that gluPerspective simply calls glFrustum.

It's like this:

void APIENTRY gluPerspective( GLdouble fovy, GLdouble aspect,
                              GLdouble zNear, GLdouble zFar )
{
   GLdouble xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax;

   ymax = zNear * tan( fovy * M_PI / 360.0 );
   ymin = -ymax;

   xmin = ymin * aspect;
   xmax = ymax * aspect;

   glFrustum( xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zNear, zFar );
}

[This is actually the source code for gluPerspective from the Mesa
library - but since it only involves regular OpenGL API, it should
work on any OpenGL implementation]

Always a good move. I have yet to hear anyone who regretted it.
