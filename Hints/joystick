There is basic joystick support in GLUT - I presume the simplest thing
to do to start with is to use that since the result will be portable to
all of our target systems.

The downside is that IIRC, GLUT only supports a very simple joystick
setup (single stick, two axes, two buttons).

Whatever API we finally choose needs to consider the portability issues.

IMHO, it would be better to extend GLUT and offer any improvements back
into the general Freeware community rather than to settle on an ad'hoc
FGFS-specific solution.

Joystick info for Linux can be found here:

  http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/

Joystick programming info for Windoze is here:

  http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/docs/joystick/pc_joystick.html#programming

That same site has a TON of interesting joystick info:

  http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/docs/joystick/

GLUT's joystick support is not documented yet since it's only present in the
very latest GLUT 3.7 beta. However, if you check the source code for that
release of GLUT, you'll see how it's done there.
