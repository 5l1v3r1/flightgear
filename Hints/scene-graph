Subject: [FGFS-Devel] Scene graph API.
Date: Fri, 12 Mar 1999 12:55:14 -0600 (CST)


I have just posted an early (pre-alpha - whatever) version of my
new Scene Graph API and simple matrix/vector math library onto my
web site:

   http://www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/ssg

...and...

   http://www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/sg

...these are the libraries that I'm using in my Tux-the-Penguin
game - so they *work* pretty well - but may not be as complete
or well-structured as they should be. There are also no example
programs (apart from the game itself) and the only file loader
is for an obscure ASCII format that nobody is likely to want
as a standard. I hope to fix that somewhat over then next few
weeks - but I'm on vacation next week.

I think these libraries could be applicable to FGFS in several
areas:

1) 3D instrument panels.

2) BUildings and other hand-created features like airfields,
   detailed city areas and so forth.

3) Other aircraft.

There are some issues about how this would all integrate into
Curts terrain rendering scheme - but I think it's do-able.

Anyway, it would be nice if people would read the manuals
and email me some comments, criticisms, suggestions, etc.
Like I said though - these are really early cuts so don't
go out and write 100,000 lines of code that depend on
them - OK?

Since I'm going to be out in the wilds of Arkansas for the
next week (Do they have email out there? I *think* they
have phones), don't expect a quick answer to any questions.
