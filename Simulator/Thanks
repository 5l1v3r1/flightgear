A very special thanks is due to the following people and groups.

Note, as hard as I've tried, I've found it impossible to perfectly
maintain this file.  If you are aware of someone who you think might
be included here, PLEASE let me know.  Projects like this are made
possible only by the help and hard work of others.  I want to properly
credit everyone who has contributed to this project.


Steve Baker <sbaker@link.com>
  Steve has provided an immense amount of coaching and tutelage, both
  on the subjects of flight simulation and OpenGL.  It has been his
  comments and thoughts that have prompted the implementation of most
  of the more sophisticated features of Flight Gear.


Gene Buckle <geneb@nwlink.com>
  Gene has done a lot of work getting FG to compile with the MSVC++
  compiler.  Also, he has pushed, proded, and bugged me endlessly to
  do my stuff right.  (I mean that in a good way, because sometimes
  when the little nudge in the right direction isn't working, I need
  a good hard shove.) :-)


Michael I. Gold <gold@puck.asd.sgi.com> -- Patiently answered my endless
  "newbie" OpenGL questions.  His effort alone has made me a great SGI
  fan.


Bruce Jackson <e.b.jackson@larc.nasa.gov> 
  http://agcbwww.larc.nasa.gov/People/ebj.html -- Developed the
  LaRCsim code which we use to provide the flight model.  Also
  patiently answered my many, many questions.


Reto Koradi <kor@mol.biol.ethz.ch> http://www.mol.biol.ethz.ch/~kor
  Helped me get on track with setting up fog effects.


Bob Kuehne <rpk@sgi.com>
  Redid the Makefile system so it is simpler and more robust.


Eric Mitchell <mitchell@mars.ark.com>
  Contributed some topnotch scenery textures.


Jonathan R Shewchuk <Jonathan_R_Shewchuk@ux4.sp.cs.cmu.edu>
  Author of the Triangle program.  Triangle is used to calculate the
  Delauney triangulation of our irregular terrain.


U.S. Geological Survey - http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/doc/edchome/ndcdb/ndcdb.html
  Provided geographic data used by this project


Robert Allan Zeh <raz@cmg.FCNBD.COM>
  Helped me tremendously in figuring out the Cygnus win32 compiler and
  how to link with .dll's.  With out him the first runable win32
  version of FG would have been impossible.
